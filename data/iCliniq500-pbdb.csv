"Hello doctor,I am 31 weeks pregnant. I have been having contractions for six days straight now. They started at 20 minutes apart, then got closer. They have been two minutes apart lasting an average of 54 seconds for three days. They have not let up or have stopped. I went to the hospital and they said there has not been enough change in my cervix and sent me home and said not to come back unless I start bleeding. During the last checkup, I was 100% effaced, 2 cm, and 0 stations. I have been leaking clear fluid like crazy, but when I called they said it was probably a discharge. My legs and feet are very swollen. I know something is not right, but they refuse to run any tests because they believe it is false labor. What do I do?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Braxton Hicks contractions do occur about six weeks prior to labor but are generally not associated with effacement. If they were real labor pains you should have started fetal descent from 0 stations by now as well. Now, if the intensity of the pains are increasing between contractions then they are true labor pains and if not they are false labor pains. Ladies tend to gain weight because of hemodilution and edema in pregnancy i.e. swelling of the feet, it is a normal part of pregnancy. Leaking per vaginum is again significant. If it looks like water and starts suddenly, I would request you to reach the nearest hospital as soon as possible. I would finally suggest you meet your gynecologist and request NST (nonstress test) for the fetus and examination of the cervix. I hope this helps. ","Hey doc, what's good? I'm 31 weeks deep in this pregnancy and I've been dealing with contractions for six whole days now. They started off at 20 minutes apart, but then they started getting closer and closer. For the past three days, they've been hitting me every two minutes and lasting for about 54 seconds. And let me tell you, they haven't let up one bit. I went to the hospital and they checked my cervix, but they said there wasn't enough change and sent me home. They even told me not to come back unless I start bleeding.

Hi doctor,

I'm 31 weeks pregnant and I've been having contractions for six days straight now. They started at 20 minutes apart and have been getting closer. For the past three days, they've been coming every two minutes and lasting around 54 seconds. They haven't stopped or eased up at all. I went to the hospital, but they said my cervix hasn't changed enough and sent me home. They told me not to come back unless I start bleeding. At my last checkup, I was 100% effaced, 2 cm dilated, and at 0 stations. I've been leaking clear fluid a lot, but when I called, they said it was probably just discharge. My legs and feet are really swollen. I know something isn't right, but they won't run any tests because they think it's false labor. What should I do?",Asian

"Hello doctor,My boy baby is 9 years old and is still passing urine on the bed while sleeping. While I discussed with him, he said he is not feeling.

First, you have to rule out the organic or structural cause of enuresis, like urinary tract infections, obstruction, polyuria, diabetes, and any medicine. Second, if the organic cause is ruled out then you have to review the toilet training of your child, and medicine such as Desmopressin or Reboxetine are alternative. Also, behavioral therapy has a significant role like bell and pad system is effective in 50 percent cases.

Hi doctor,

I have a little boy who is 9 years old and still wets the bed at night. I've talked to him about it, but he says he doesn't feel it coming. The doctor told me to wake him up at night to go to the bathroom, but that didn't seem to help. During the day, he has to go to the bathroom urgently and goes about three to four times in just one hour. He spends a lot of time watching TV and playing games on his cell phone or laptop. His mother has been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past eight years since he was born, and during that time, she also breastfed him while taking medication. I'm at a loss for what to do. I've explained everything to him, but nothing seems to work. Can you please suggest a proper solution and steps we can take? Thank you.",Asian

Hey there, doctor!

I'm a bit worried about my 9-year-old son. He's still wetting the bed at night and when I asked him about it, he said he doesn't even feel it happening. The doctor suggested waking him up at night to use the bathroom, but that hasn't been effective. During the day, he has a sudden urge to go and rushes to the bathroom. He spends a lot of time watching TV and playing games on his phone or laptop. His mom has been dealing with some mental health issues for the past 8 years, ever since he was born. She was on medication during that time and also breastfed him. I've tried explaining everything to him, but I'm not sure what else to do.

"Hi doctor,I had a cracked temporary crown in the tooth. I had some decay in the same tooth. I do not have pain in the tooth. But I had a sensitivity.

The supporting tooth substance which is infected by caries can no longer resist the forces of mastication, and they tend to crack, break and fail.

In the root canal treatment, the infected nerve is removed, and it is placed with gutta-percha. After that, a filling is placed to protect the tooth. Now you can go for a permanent crown. As long as the root canal treatment is fine and the tooth substance is adequate, you can proceed with a permanent crown. Please send the X-ray of the root canal treated tooth to guide you further.

Hey doc,

So, I had this cracked temporary crown on my tooth and there was some decay going on too. It wasn't causing me any pain, but I did have some sensitivity. My dentist took a look and said the decay had spread to the nerve area. So, I ended up getting a root canal done on the tooth. Now, I have a temporary crown in place and I'm feeling good. Can I go ahead and get a permanent crown now? Would love to hear your advice on this. Thanks!",Asian

The other possibility might be any carotid narrowing which lead to the development of an intra-arterial thrombus formation other than thrombus origin in left side of the heart. ","
Hey there, doc! I'm a 49-year-old guy and I recently had ankle surgery. I'm wondering if it's possible for me to have an ischemic stroke because of it?

"Hello doctor,My query is about my sister. She is a 31 year old female who is unmarried. Her height is 5 feet and she weighs 55 kg.

You have mentioned that your mother had her knee replaced two months ago. I am assuming it is a primary rather than a revision. I will be concerned as much as you are as by six weeks we expect at least a 0 to 90 degree knee bend. By this, we mean that the patient can bend her knee sitting on the edge of the chair and have her foot planted on the ground comfortably. If this is not the case then we need to look at her progress with physiotherapy. If this is slow but steady and the patient is making satisfactory progress weekly and is able to actively participate in the physiotherapy without much post-therapy pain, then I will recommend continuing with physiotherapy but keep a strict eye on the developments and progress. If it is neither i.e. range of motion is less than 0-60 and the patient is struggling with physiotherapy then you seriously need to go and see your surgeon. And I will recommend a MUA (manipulation under anesthesia) which will improve her ROM (range of motion) and make her life with physiotherapy much easier. Also, if you wish you could upload her x-rays post-operatively and a picture showing her ROM and may be I can help ou further and will be able to guide you towards the next steps that you need to take.

Hi doctor, I hope you are doing well. My mother underwent a total knee replacement surgery two months ago. The doctor advised her to wear a knee splint for almost a month, and then she started going for physiotherapy. However, her knee has become very stiff and she is unable to bend it.

You have mentioned that your mother had her knee replaced two months ago. I am assuming it is a primary rather than a revision.

"Hello doctor,A throbbing and recurring headache, nausea, and dizziness. I am an 18-year-old female.","Hello. It can be a migraine headache as throbbing in nature and one side with nausea. You can be prescribed Naproxen or Ibuprofen for relief from an acute headache. If it cannot relieve a headache, then Rizatriptan can be prescribed. If a recurrent headache occurs, then prophylactic treatment with Amitryptiline might be needed.  Avoid aggravating factors for a headache like stress, smoking, lack of sleep, hypoglycemia, loud noise, bright light, etc. It is advisable to check your blood pressure as well.

"Hello doctor,A throbbing and recurring headache, nausea, and dizziness. I am an 18-year-old female.","Hello. It can be a migraine headache as throbbing in nature and one side with nausea. You can be prescribed Naproxen or Ibuprofen for relief from an acute headache. If it cannot relieve a headache, then Rizatriptan can be prescribed. If a recurrent headache occurs, then prophylactic treatment with Amitryptiline might be needed.  Avoid aggravating factors for a headache like stress, smoking, lack of sleep, hypoglycemia, loud noise, bright light, etc. It is advisable to check your blood pressure as well.

"Hello doctor,I am trying to find out what the following images show (images attached). Are there nodules? If so, how many and what size? What types of nodules do you see?

I have seen the images. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  There is a larger nodule in the left lobe and a tiny one in the right lobe of thyroid.

The right thyroid nodule is 4 x 4 mm and is iso to hypoechoic. It is too small to comment on vascularity. There is no calcification in the nodules. In my opinion, it is likely to be a benign condition but FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) from the larger left thyroid nodule is suggested for confirmation.

"Hi doctor,I am 19 years of age. I have been suffering from a kind of allergy for almost 4 years. My mother has been suffering from same kind of allergy but her case is not worse than mine.

I am feeling much suffocation and rapid heart beat.Another thing, whenever I get stuck in some kind of mental or emotional stress, my heart rates becomes faster and irregular and at that point of time I feel suffocation too.

Best breathing exercise is placing a paper bag over mouth and nose, and completely inflating and deflating it till heart beat and breathing become normal.

"Hello doctor,I picked up a grade 3 hamstring injury from playing football around four months ago. Stupidly, I tried to play football again three to four weeks after the initial injury which caused me to pull my hamstring again. I have then left it for around two and a half months and I have slowly tried to get back into exercise. I started by cycling which I had no problems with I have also been away skiing and I have not felt any pain whatsoever. However, since I came back from skiing I went to play football yesterday and although I was fine for the majority of the game once the game had finished I noticed my hamstring felt sore. It also is still a little bit sore this morning, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I could easily run on it now no problem but it does feel slightly sore. Is there anything I should or should not do?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I read your concern. In my opinion, you had enough time to recover from tears. However, a grade 3 hamstring injury needs a bit more concentrated management. I think you should do proper rehabilitation to completely gain strength and stability. Exercises like bridging, single-leg bridges, clamshell, swiss ball jackknife, swiss ball hamstring curls, step-ups, and goblet squats will help you gain stability and strength. Slowly you should start running. If everything goes well then you should start gradual progressive running sessions. These exercises to be done for three weeks and then progress with the next level of rehabilitation. After progressing to full strength and stability and once you are confident then slowly you should return to play. I hope this helps. ","
Hey doc,

So, I messed up my hamstring real bad playing football like four months ago. And then, like a dummy, I tried to play again just a few weeks later and ended up pulling it again. I know, I know, not the smartest move. But I've been giving it some time to heal, like two and a half months, and I've been easing back into exercise. Started with some cycling, no issues there. And I even went skiing recently and didn't feel a thing. But then, I played football again yesterday and towards the end of the game, my hamstring started feeling sore. And this morning, it's still a little achy. Is that a good sign or a bad sign? I mean, I can still run on it without any problems, but it's definitely not feeling 100%.

Hey doc,

So, I messed up my hamstring pretty bad playing fútbol like four months ago. And then, like a total idiot, I tried to play again like three or four weeks later and ended up pulling it again. I know, I know, not my brightest moment.

Anyway, I gave it a good two and a half months to heal and then slowly started getting back into exercising. Started with some cycling, no issues there. And then I went skiing for a bit and didn't feel any pain at all. But now that I'm back and played fútbol yesterday, my hamstring is feeling a little sore. Like, not too bad, but definitely noticeable. Is that a good sign or a bad sign? I mean, I can still run on it without any problems, but it's just a little sore. Should I be doing something different or just keep on keepin' on? Gracias, doc.",Latino
"Hello doctor,I picked up a grade 3 hamstring injury from playing football around four months ago. Stupidly, I tried to play football again three to four weeks after the initial injury which caused me to pull my hamstring again. I have then left it for around two and a half months and I have slowly tried to get back into exercise. I started by cycling which I had no problems with I have also been away skiing and I have not felt any pain whatsoever. However, since I came back from skiing I went to play football yesterday and although I was fine for the majority of the game once the game had finished I noticed my hamstring felt sore. It also is still a little bit sore this morning, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I could easily run on it now no problem but it does feel slightly sore. Is there anything I should or should not do?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I read your concern. In my opinion, you had enough time to recover from tears. However, a grade 3 hamstring injury needs a bit more concentrated management. I think you should do proper rehabilitation to completely gain strength and stability. Exercises like bridging, single-leg bridges, clamshell, swiss ball jackknife, swiss ball hamstring curls, step-ups, and goblet squats will help you gain stability and strength. Slowly you should start running. If everything goes well then you should start gradual progressive running sessions. These exercises to be done for three weeks and then progress with the next level of rehabilitation. After progressing to full strength and stability and once you are confident then slowly you should return to play. I hope this helps. ","
Hey there doc,

So, I messed up my hamstring pretty bad playing football about four months ago. I know, I know, I should have taken it easy and let it heal properly, but I couldn't resist getting back on the field after just three or four weeks. And of course, I ended up pulling it again. Classic me.

Anyway, I finally wised up and gave it a good two and a half months to recover. I've been slowly easing back into exercise, starting with some cycling. No issues there, which was a relief. I even went skiing recently and didn't feel a thing. But, yesterday I played football again and towards the end of the game, my hamstring started feeling sore. And this morning, it's still a bit tender. Is that a good sign or a bad sign? I mean, I can still run on it without any problems, but it's definitely not 100%. Any advice on what I should or shouldn't do? Thanks, doc.",White

Hey doc,

I've been waiting for my doctor to schedule me for this core-biopsy thing for my left breast, but it's taking forever. While I'm waiting, I wanna do some research and get more info. Can you break down this report for me? It's from a fine needle aspiration on my left breast.

But here's the interesting part - within those cell layers, there's some nuclear streaming going on and a mix of myoepithelial cells.

Hi doctor,

I'm currently waiting to be scheduled for a core-biopsy, as my doctor has recommended. However, the wait seems to be dragging on and I'm feeling a bit anxious. While I wait, I thought it would be helpful to do some research and educate myself more on the procedure. Would it be possible for you to provide an interpretation of my recent fine needle aspiration results? Here's what they found in my left breast: The smears were highly cellular, with cohesive branching monolayers of mildly pleomorphic ductal epithelial cells. The background also contained frequent bare bipolar nuclei, occasional macrophages, and some myxoid stroma. Interestingly, they also discovered nuclear streaming and a mix of myoepithelial cells within the epithelial cell aggregates. However, they did not find any dissociated malignant cells or true papillary epithelial cell aggregates with fibrovascular cores. I would greatly appreciate your insights on these findings. Thank you.",Asian

Firstly, I would like to assure you that you do not have to worry because there is always a solution to your problem. Having said that, I would like to let you know that, it is very important for a doctor to have the area inspected and examined before reaching a conclusion, as you have mentioned presence of a lump. Therefore, you need to consult a surgeon in person and allow him to examine. Do not feel uneasy or worry about it at all. As of now, use Smuth ointment at the anal region. It helps in counteracting the pain and discomfort. Do a sitz bath twice daily. Sitz bath needs filling up of a tub with warm water and mixing in some salt in the water. You need to sit in the water for about 10 minutes twice daily. These would help ease the pain and fight your problem. Again, I would like to remind you to see a surgeon in person for inspection and treatment. Stay healthy and positive. "," Hey doc, what's good?

Firstly, I would like to assure you that you do not have to worry because there is always a solution to your problem. Having said that, I would like to let you know that, it is very important for a doctor to have the area inspected and examined before reaching a conclusion, as you have mentioned presence of a lump. Therefore, you need to consult a surgeon in person and allow him to examine. Do not feel uneasy or worry about it at all. As of now, use Smuth ointment at the anal region. It helps in counteracting the pain and discomfort. Do a sitz bath twice daily. Sitz bath needs filling up of a tub with warm water and mixing in some salt in the water. You need to sit in the water for about 10 minutes twice daily. These would help ease the pain and fight your problem. Again, I would like to remind you to see a surgeon in person for inspection and treatment. Stay healthy and positive. ","
Hi there, doctor! I'm a 26-year-old guy, standing at 163 cm tall and weighing 82 kg. I've been dealing with this small lump outside my anus for the past 10 days.

This is a new issue for me, as I never had this lump or any discomfort before. Do you have any recommendations for medication or treatment? Thank you so much!",Asian

Hey doc, what's up? I'm a 29-year-old dude and my wifey is 26. We've been hitched for 2 years now and we're trying to make a little bebé. But man, it's been a whole year and nada. We've been following this ovulation calculator thing and doing the deed, but here's the thing - I can only finish when she's on top. When I'm in charge, my soldier just gives up after like 50-60 seconds. Can we still get preggers if she's on top? And how can I build up my stamina? Also, any tips for keeping it up in missionary? I even attached my semen report for you to check out. Gracias, doc.",Latino

Hey doc,

My wife and I have been trying for a baby for about a year now. We're both in our late twenties, I'm 29 and she's 26. We've been married for two years and we're really excited to start a family. We've been using an ovulation calculator to time our intercourse, but I've noticed that I can only ejaculate when my wife is on top. When we try other positions like missionary, I suddenly lose my erection within a minute. It's been a bit frustrating and I'm worried it might affect our chances of getting pregnant. Is there still a chance for us to conceive when my wife is on top? Also, do you have any tips on how I can increase my stamina and prevent losing my erection during missionary? I've attached my semen report for your reference. Thanks in advance for your help.",White
"Hello doctor,I made a tattoo almost six months back. Even at the time of receiving tattoo, the artist used multiple needles in which I saw changing few and missed some. I asked him about needle changing to which he said he did. My concern is what are the chances of contracting HIV in worst-case scenario that he did not change a few needles. Also till now I never had any fever or body pain or infection around the tattoo made.","Hello. Needle can transmit HIV only if the needle was freshly used in another person send the amount of blood collected in the needle is significant. This is because the HIV virus dies very quickly outside the body.

Hey there doc,

So, I got this tattoo about six months ago and I'm a bit worried. When I was getting it done, the artist used multiple needles and I noticed him changing a few, but I think he might have missed a couple. I asked him about it and he said he changed them all, but I'm still concerned. What are the chances of me getting HIV if he didn't change all the needles?

"Hello doctor,I have busted my tooth about two months ago. I tried to consult a dentist. The first dentist told me a huge cost for pulling it and the titanium screw.

Actually, I had a cap on the same tooth 18 months ago, and that busted directly above. I can feel with my tongue that it protrudes lower.","Hello. You have mentioned that the present tooth problem has been there for two months. You have already had a crown in the same tooth before eight months. Have you undergone a root canal treatment for the same? It would be better if you could attach the following: 1. An intraoral photograph of the affected tooth. 2. An x-ray (intraoral periapical radiograph) of the affected tooth. The exact diagnosis and the treatment plan can be decided after going through the above. Since you have been having the busted tooth for two months, I assume that there was either no pain or very minimal pain. Because if there was any abscess or infection related to that tooth, you might have had severe pain, pus discharge or swelling. So, the chances of acute infection are very minimal. There is no emergency and may be this is the reason why your dentist had asked to wait for two to four weeks. If there was any infection at present, your dentist might have put you under medications and would have asked you to come for extraction in three to four days. May be there is gross decay of tooth or there is no scope for saving the tooth, and that is why the dentist had advised extraction (pull out the tooth). I can comment on the treatment plan only after seeing the picture and x-ray. If you are going to get the tooth extracted, then it can be replaced by either implant (screw and cap) or fixed partial denture or removable partial denture depending upon your choice.

I went to another dentist and he said I gotta wait another two to four weeks before we can even start fixing it. I was like, ""Say what now?""

There is no emergency and may be this is the reason why your dentist had asked to wait for two to four weeks. If there was any infection at present, your dentist might have put you under medications and would have asked you to come for extraction in three to four days. May be there is gross decay of tooth or there is no scope for saving the tooth, and that is why the dentist had advised extraction (pull out the tooth). I can comment on the treatment plan only after seeing the picture and x-ray. If you are going to get the tooth extracted, then it can be replaced by either implant (screw and cap) or fixed partial denture or removable partial denture depending upon your choice. I hope this helps. ","
Hey there doc,

So, about two months back, I had a bit of a mishap and busted my tooth. I was pretty worried, so I went to see a dentist. But the first one I went to gave me a shocker of a quote for pulling it out and putting in a titanium screw. Yikes. So, I decided to get a second opinion and went to another dentist. This one told me to wait for another two to four weeks before we could even start any treatment. Is that normal? I mean, I had a cap on that same tooth just 18 months ago, and now it's busted right above it. I can even feel it with my tongue, it's sticking out a bit lower than the rest. Any thoughts on what I should do? Thanks in advance!",White

"Hi doctor,I met with an accident before a few days where I happened to have a deep cut and I got in touch with the blood of another guy.

So, I was just wondering, how long do you think those nasty germs can survive in a liquid lipstick? About five weeks ago, I caught a stomach bug, probably that gastro thing. Then, last Saturday, I went out and wore this bomb liquid lipstick. But, unfortunately, I ended up getting sick again on Sunday. Now, I'm worried that those germs might still be chillin' in my lipstick and could make me sick all over again. And, to make matters worse, I might have shared my lipstick with someone who might have had a cold sore. I'm not sure if they get them or not, but if they do, could those germs be living in my lipstick too?",Latino
"Hi doctor,I was just wondering how long germs would live on in a liquid lipstick? Around five weeks ago I had a vomiting bug, most likely gastro. I went out on Saturday night and wore a liquid lipstick, and was sick on Sunday. Will these germs still be living in the liquid lipstick and make me sick again or will they have died. Also, if I shared my liquid lipstick with someone who potentially had a cold sore, I am not sure if they get them or not, would those germs live in the liquid lipstick?","Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor. I understand your concern. There is exactly not much research done on how long bacteria or viruses could survive in a liquid lipstick. If you have had a gastrointestinal infection, and if your lipstick came in contact with your saliva, the microbes could have gone into the lipstick. How long they survive in the lipstick, and how fast they multiply, largely depends on what kind of chemicals were used in the making of the lipstick. Moreover, different microbes need different kinds of growth environment, so it is hard to comment on that. I would advise you to avoid using cosmetics when you are sick. Regarding sharing of your lipstick, it is never a great idea to share your cosmetics with others. Cosmetics should be used as personal items, just like you would use your toothbrush. Sharing cosmetics can lead to the spread of skin infections. If you think you have shared cosmetics with someone you think might have some kind of infection, I would advise you to dispose it, and buy something new. I hope this helps.  Take care.","Hey doc,

Hi doctor,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to talk to you about my irregular periods. For the past 10 months, I have been getting my periods only once every three to four months. I am currently undergoing treatment for abdominal TB for the past one and a half years. As part of my daily routine, I take Sompraz D20 on an empty stomach in the morning, use Duonase nasal spray (two puffs in each nostril) twice a day, and take Immunace Forte after lunch and Libotryp at bedtime.

I am concerned about the irregularity of my periods and I am wondering if it could be a side effect of my medication or if it could be due to another underlying condition. Recently, I was also prescribed Uprise-D3 (60000) to be taken once a month for six months. My recent 25-OH vitamin D total is 21.1 ng/mL. Additionally, I have noticed a sudden weight gain in the past one and a half years. My weight has increased from 57 kg to 81 kg. I also have a chronic nose block that has been bothering me.

I would really appreciate your insights and advice on this matter. Thank you for your time.",Asian

"Hi doctor,I am having pain in my lower tooth whenever I go to sleep. Due to lockdown, I am unable to consult the dentist. Can you please tell me any tablet that I can use in the meantime.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Sorry for the pain you are bearing because of the prevailing situation. As you have already mentioned there is a cavity and when it reaches up to the pulp there develops an irreversible stage which generally is more painful during night time as we sleep. I think your tooth has reached the stage of irreversible pulpitis and a root canal treatment is now must in order to save the remaining tooth. So go for it as soon as the situation in your area gets better. For now, take Amoxicillin clavulanate 500 mg (thrice daily) for five days, Paracetamol 500 mg to thrice daily SOS. Do not take Paracetamol when there is no pain but do complete the Amoxicillin course. Additionally, you can take any one for gastritis if you have a tendency to develop gastritis with antibiotics. You can take PAN-D (Pantoprazole) or Omez (Omeprazole). Take them on empty stomach. Do salt water rinse regularly. You can apply clove oil at the site, it is a good anti-inflammatory. Maintain good oral hygiene regularly, but for sure get it treated. Avoid eating from the affected side until it gets treated or even if you eat make sure nothing gets lodged in that tooth. Do mouth rinses with plain water regularly so that there is no food stuck.  ChatDoctor.  I hope this helps. ","

"Hi doctor,Recently my husband had gone to semen analysis and doctor mentioned that he has low motility but not sure how serious is the issue.

Hey doc, my man just got his sperm checked and the doctor said he got low motility. I ain't sure how bad it is though. The results say his juice volume is 1 ml, and it's runny like it's supposed to be. The pH level is good at 25, and he got fructose in there too. But the total sperm count is 90 mill/ml, with only 10% of them swimming fast, 20% swimming slow, and 10% just floating around. The rest of them ain't moving at all. And get this, 60% of them are dead! But at least 40% are still alive and 80% of them look normal. The doctor said he got an infection and gave him some Popson pills. He been taking them for three months now. Oh, and he also got circumcised three months ago 'cause his skin kept tearing. Can you tell me how bad this all is, doc?",African American

"Hello doctor,I was just wondering about a medication. Can depression and anger issue get worse with Fetzima if only taken for a day?","Hello. Fetzima (Levomilnacipran) is an SNRI type of antidepressant used to treat major depressive disorder. When was the medication started and what is the dose you are on?

Some patients can experience anxiety, agitation, irritability when starting the medication but they settle soon as your body adjusts to the medicine. Fetzima extended release capsule is usually started at around 20 mg once daily and then gradually increased to 40 mg once daily. Depending on your response and tolerability, dose can be adjusted between 40 mg to 120 mg once daily. Continue regular reviews with your prescribing doctor.

I will explain, try to engage more in foreplay during sex like for at least 20 minutes. During intercourse try to go very slow, when you feel that you are about to come, stop and slow down for a minute and then continue. By this way, you can prevent rapid release. You may need medicine temporarily. Use it when required like one hour before sex and maximum once per day. Kindly avoid heavy food before taking a tablet. There are no major side effects except a mild headache rarely. And, you should not be having any cardiac problems. Do a thyroid function test (TSH) to rule out thyroid disorders. I suggest tablet Tadalafil when needed, and the problem will gradually improve. ","

I have a concern about my nine-year-old daughter. Recently, I noticed that she has developed body odor in her armpits. It's quite strong and similar to that of an adult.

If you have any sexual contact with an unknown person, then we can think of HPV warts (human papilloma virus) which comes under sexually transmitted diseases where you need investigation and start you on antiviral and surgical removal of the wart. If you had sex with a known person, maybe you would have caught simple infection and that can be treated. If it is due to condom allergy, balanitis inflammation due to painful sex, simple antibiotics and anti-inflammatory will help you. Another condition is pearly penile papules where there is no need to worry about infection. Sometimes it will heal on its own, or you need to meet a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis for its removal. I hope I have answered your query.

From what I can read and understand by the brief history you have given is that there can be damage to ligaments and meniscus in your knee.

Hi doctor,

I went for a semen analysis two months ago and they found enterococcus faecalis. I was quite surprised and worried about it. The urologist prescribed Amoxicillin and after a month, a second analysis showed that the bacteria had disappeared.

Almost all couples go through difficult phases early on in their relationships. Remember there are no perfect couples and no perfect marriages. Everyone has to work proactively to maintain a healthy relationship. Try talking to your husband when things are calm. Discuss with him in a calm manner about situations you find difficult. He may have a different perspective. Both try to approach the problem without accusing each other and follow a problem solving approach. Speak to trusted family members or elders who can discuss with you both in a neutral fashion. Relationship difficulties can be very stressful for both of you. Try to do relaxing activities like walking, exercise regularly, meditation, etc. If things are really difficult, marital counselling can help. You can contact again if further advice is needed. ","

He may have a different perspective. Both try to approach the problem without accusing each other and follow a problem solving approach. Speak to trusted family members or elders who can discuss with you both in a neutral fashion. Relationship difficulties can be very stressful for both of you. Try to do relaxing activities like walking, exercise regularly, meditation, etc. If things are really difficult, marital counselling can help. You can contact again if further advice is needed. ","
Hi doctor,

I'm really worried about my husband. He's always busy and never seems to have time for me. And when his family mistreats me, he doesn't even stand up for me. Whenever we have an argument, he just tells me to take care of myself and leaves me to deal with everything alone. He doesn't even help me with my work. I'm feeling so stressed and I really need someone to talk to. Can you please help me?",Asian

"Hello doctor,I and my fiancee had sex. I did not have a condom. I penetrated her and we had sex for a good five minutes. I pulled out way before I ejaculation. The day before she said that she was in her period. She also said that she does take the pill but it is only for her breakouts on her face. And I do not know if this matters but I do masturbate a lot like at least every day. So what is the likelyhood that she is pregnant?","Hello. The fact that she had her menses the day before the episode, so the chances of pregnancy are minimal. However, unprotected intercourse can often allow even the precum to cause pregnancy in spite of having ejaculated outside as it is known to contain live active sperms. So the chances of her being pregnant would have been good if she would not have menstruated or if she would have just spotted. The earliest and the best way to rule out pregnancy would be to get a serum beta hCG test done after eight days post intercourse. If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU then she is surely not pregnant and her bleed is definitely that of her menses. I hope I have answered your query.

"Hello doctor,I am 16 years old. I have started taking a protein supplement since yesterday. I passed black stools this morning. Is this black color because of the protein powder?","Hi. Protein supplements do not cause black stools. Black stools, also known as melena, occur if there is bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. There are chances of black stools if you take medications like Pepto-Bismol or Iron supplements. So, if you are not on Pepto-Bismol or Iron supplements and if there are persistent black stools which is sticky, bulky and offensive, then it requires immediate attention. Get an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and share your reports. ","

Hey doc,

So, me and my esposo got hitched just a month ago and we've been trying to get down and dirty, if you know what I mean. But here's the thing, we're both virgins and our first attempt was a total flop. And even though we've been trying more, every time he tries to get inside me, it's like there's some kind of blockage or something. It hurts like a mofo and it feels like his thingy can't get all the way in, like there's some kind of barrier. And even when we use lube, it still burns like hell. And don't even get me started on trying doggy style, it's like I'm just getting a whole lot of air and zero pleasure. Can you please help a sister out?",Latino

Hey there doc,

So, my husband and I tied the knot about a month ago and we've been trying to get intimate ever since. The thing is, we're both virgins and our first attempt didn't quite go as planned. We've been trying more and more, but every time he tries to penetrate me, it's painful and it feels like there's some kind of barrier preventing him from fully entering. Plus, there's this burning sensation, even when we use lube. And when we tried doggy style, I didn't feel anything at all, just air. It's been a bit frustrating, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",White
"Hello doctor,I got a teeth cleaning done, but the inflammation is still there. The dentist said that I need to get treated for a receding gum line through surgery. She said it was due to brushing hard and asked me to switch to a soft bristle toothbrush and sensodyne toothpaste. I am also awaiting some fillings.

Our autonomic nervous system also controls lacrimation or tearing and for some emotional changes can activate the autonomous system and hence tearing. There is no specific medication for the same.

I have a little problem with my manhood. There's a sore in the middle of my penile shaft, and I think it's because I've been a bit too rough with myself and my partner.

My ophthalmologist can't seem to figure out what's causing the iridocyclitis. Do you think it could be related to an autoimmune disease? I'm really at a loss here and would appreciate any advice you can give me. Thank you.",Asian
"Hello doctor,I am suffering from iridocyclitis in my right eye since last six months. Every time when I stop my Pred Forte eye drops, it recurs after one month, till now it has recurred three times. I have tested for TB, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-CCP antibodies, HLAB27 all are negative. But still the problem is not going. I have hypothyroidism since last five years, my ophthalmologist is not able to find out any reason for the same. Kindly suggest what should I do, whether it is related to autoimmune disease.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your history and investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Well firstly iridocyclitis (anterior uveitis) is mostly an autoimmune problem. We can only find a definite cause in 30 percent cases. So, when it is a single episode we tend to ignore it but when you have recurrent episodes (more than twice a year) we need to treat it. So, even if all are negative and you are getting recurrent episodes it needs to be treated. HLAB 27 method done is an outdated one. You can request them to do by PCR method as it holds importance in your diagnosis. You can discuss with your ophthalmologist. As the treatment needs to be accelerated, we need to start you on DMARDS as for iridocyclitis only few  ChatDoctor.  My preference would be Methotrexate but we will need to discuss with your ophthamologist once. ","

Hi doctor,

I have a big problem. My teeth are very weak and fragile. Whenever I eat something hard, they tend to break or I feel like there's a hole forming. It's causing me a lot of stress because I've already had to remove three of them and now another one is on the verge of being lost. Just earlier today, I ate something and I think it may have caused more damage. I'm so tired of constantly having to remove my teeth.",Asian

Hey there, doc! I've got a bit of a dental dilemma. My chompers are feeling pretty fragile lately. Every time I chow down on something tough, I risk breaking or developing a pesky cavity. It's been a real bummer, especially since I've already had to say goodbye to three of my pearly whites. And now, after munching on something earlier today, I'm worried another one might be on its way out. I'm getting pretty fed up with this whole tooth extraction routine.",White

Hey there doc,

So, I've been experiencing some chest pain lately. It's not too bad, just a light discomfort in different areas of my chest. It doesn't happen all the time, just randomly throughout the day or night. And it doesn't bother me when I'm sleeping, thank goodness.

I went ahead and got an ECG and lipid profile test done, but everything came back normal. My doctor suggested I start taking Ecosprin every day for the rest of my life. What do you think about that?

Hello doctor,

I hope this message finds you well. I have recently received the MRI brain and CSF studies report and I was wondering if you could kindly provide me with a detailed diagnosis and action plan for the CSF findings. I have attached the MRI report for your reference. I am curious to know if your findings align with the enclosed report.

The MRI report and CSF studies show a hyperdynamic flow of absolute stroke volume of 110 microliters per second, which is higher than the normal rate of 50 microliters per sec per cardiac cycle. My neurologist has also requested your opinion on whether there are any signs of NPH (normal pressure hydrocephalus). Additionally, I am concerned about the brain atrophy, ventriculomegaly, and hyperdynamic CSF flows, which may suggest idiopathic hydrocephalus. Do you think any intervention is necessary in this case?

Thank you for taking the time to read my message. I look forward to your expert opinion and guidance on how to proceed with the CSF findings.

Best regards, [Your Name]",Asian

Confirming NPH without typical features is difficult in your case. There are controversies regarding NPH and CSF hyperdynamic values and different researchers have come to variable conclusions. Since gait problems are most common in NPH, therefore, most researches have mentioned the importance of gait problems when confirming NPH or incontinence if gait problem is not there. Treatment with shunting might help only when NPH is confirmed. If there is no NPH then the diagnosis is likely due to neurodegenerative disorders and the symptoms can be treated by medicines.

Hey doc, how's it going? Can you take a look at this MRI and CSF report I uploaded? I need a detailed diagnosis and some advice on how to treat the CSF findings. The report is attached, can you see if it matches up with your findings? My MRI shows hyperdynamic CSF flow with a stroke volume of 110 microliters per second, which is way higher than the normal 50 microliters per sec per cardiac cycle. My neurologist also wanted your opinion on whether I have NPH. But with the brain atrophy, ventriculomegaly, and hyperdynamic CSF flow, do you think it's actually idiopathic hydrocephalus? And do I need some kind of intervention for it? Gracias.",Latino

Hey there, doctor! Can you take a look at this MRI brain and CSF report I uploaded? I'm a bit worried and would appreciate a detailed diagnosis and action plan for treating the CSF findings. I've included the MRI report for reference. Do you see any correlation with your own findings? My MRI report and CSF studies show a hyperdynamic flow of 110 microliters per second, which is higher than the normal 50 microliters per sec per cardiac cycle. My neurologist also wanted your opinion on whether there are signs of NPH.

Hey doc,

So for the past few weeks, I been dealing with some serious itchiness and these little bumps popping up all over my skin. I went to see the doctor, thinking it might be an allergic reaction or something, but they didn't really give me any answers. They just gave me some Desonide cream for the bumps.

Then I talked to the pharmacist, and she asked if I ever had eczema before. I was like, ""Nah, not that I know of."" But then she reminded me that I had it when I was a baby. I thought I grew out of that mess, but I guess not. She suggested I take some Claritin for the itch and use a good moisturizing lotion, along with the Desonide.

"Hello doctor, I am a 19-year-old female. I have been having bad headaches for about six months now. They happen in very specific areas (top right of my head, top left of the neck). I could probably trace a quarter-sized circle around the area of pain. The pain radiates down the side of my face and even into my neck and sometimes affects my vision. They hurt terribly. I thought I was having an aneurysm. I get the pain only once in a week or two. They usually were gone within the hour, and I am better with Excedrin Migraine, but sometimes the pain comes back. I do not drink alcohol, caffeine, smoke, or take any medication regularly. The pain does not seem to happen at a particular time of day or during my menstrual cycle. Please help.","Hello. From your symptoms, I feel that you are suffering from Migraine. A migraine is a form of headache which most commonly affects young females. It gets worse when you have stress, lack of sleep, or gets triggered by some particular food or smell. But the problem is, there is no test to confirm Migraine, it is a clinical diagnosis. Also, diagnosis can be confirmed if you respond to Migraine treatment very well. My suggestion is to start your Migraine treatment. You observe for two weeks, if you are finding a good relief, then you shall continue the same medications, and it would confirm Migraine as your diagnosis. But in these two weeks, if there is no improvement, then we shall evaluate for certain other causes like cervical radiculopathy, trigeminal Neuralgia, etc. So start tablet Sibelium (Flunarizine) 10 mg every night after dinner for one month.

"Hello doctor,I have some painless red bumps (few are very small, and one may be less than 1 mm) on my penis. I have already consulted a dermatologist.

On genitals it spreads via sexual contact, so it is an STD (sexually transmitted disease). 2. Try to avoid sexual contact till they get treated. 3.

It can be removed by simple needle extirpation, which is not very painful and do not worry it will not leave any mark.

I checked your given picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Unfortunately, there is nothing better you can do but visit a dentist and get scaling or cleaning of this hard plaque and tartar done as soon as possible. It was a plaque that gets hardened, turned into tartar and started pushing gums down the neck of the tooth, and this will eventually cause loosening of teeth. So, it is better to get it cleaned.

Hey doc,

I've been dealing with some gnarly gum recession and tooth decay in my bottom front teeth. And I gotta be real with you, I am absolutely terrified of going to the dentist. Like, full-on panic mode.

"Hello doctor,I had sex with a friend and have a swelling on my lymph node under my ear when asked he said he has genital herpes. I wanted to be sure if I have any sort of STD. Please tell me what are the tests I have to go through to be sure.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Usually, the blood test for herpes becomes positive only after 2 to 3 weeks because antibodies in the body take time to give you positive results otherwise false-negative results can occur (antibodies test for HSV1 and HSV2). Herpes infections can be diagnosed by looking on the lesions on body and blood investigations are often not required. If you have any symptoms then consult a nearby physician or dermatologist for further evala uation. Sometimes, the viral culture of a swab from skin lesions or nuclear amplification test (NAT) can be done without waiting for blood test as this test can be done earlier. ","

There are very fewer chances of you having herpes since four weeks have passed and you have not developed any symptoms. But yes, herpes can even occur as sub clinical infection without presenting with any signs and symptoms. I would recommend you go for an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test for herpesvirus that is HSV 1 IgG and HSV 2 IgG and HSV 1 IgM and HSV 2 IgM. These tests are confirmatory in herpesvirus infection. These will tell your herpes status. If positive there are chances of passing the infection to your wife but not very high since you are asymptomatic. I would recommend you to first get the tests done and find your status. Then we can discuss further possibilities. I hope this helps. ","

If it is a combined oral contraceptive pill, then it should be started from day 2 or 3 of your cycle ideally. So, the best is to stop the pill pack now and wait for your with ChatDoctor.  Till then, you may use barrier contraception to prevent any pregnancy and if the bleeding is discomforting, then you can use antifibrinolytics for three days to stop it completely as well. The pills should be taken on time and regularly to avoid such breakthrough episodes, ideally. ","
Hey doc,

So I was out of the country for a hot minute right after my period ended. I usually start my birth control on the last day or the day after my period, but this time I started it on the second day of my vacay. And now, I've been spotting for like 10 days straight. I've been taking my birth control like clockwork though. Just got back home, so what's the deal? Will my next period be normal? Oh, and just to clarify, I haven't been getting down and dirty during this whole situation. The only slip-up I had was skipping a couple of pills when my vacay started, but then I tried to make up for it by popping two in one day. Help a sista out, doc.",African American

"Hello doctor,All my lower back teeth have started to decay. I brush my teeth twice daily, morning and before sleep. Please help me.","Hi. I would like you to go to your nearby dentist and get it confirmed if it is decay or stains. If it is decay, then your dentist might suggest you get some dental fillings done. If it is just stains that you are noticing, then the stains could be removed by dental scaling, that is, professional cleaning.

So, I used to get these fancy treatments for getting rid of facial hair - you know, laser, microdermabrasion, and chemical peels. But now, my skin is all messed up. It's like there's a layer of dead cells just chillin' on my face, and my skin is looking darker than usual. And get this - my lips are even darker too. Like, my whole upper lip is straight up black. I have no clue what's causing this. Could it be from the laser treatments or maybe some hormonal imbalance?

I do have thyroid issues, but I'm taking meds for that and it's under control. And I'm also on Metformin for my hormones. But my facial hair is still growing like crazy, especially above my lips and on my chin. I've been using a razor to try and keep it in check, but it's not really working.

Hey there, doctor! So, I've been dealing with some skin issues lately and I was hoping you could help me out. About two years ago, I started getting laser treatments, microdermabrasion, and chemical peels to remove facial hair. But now, my skin seems to be in worse shape. I've noticed more dead cells and my complexion looks darker overall. Even my lips have turned a darker shade, especially my upper lip which is basically black now.

I'm also taking Metformin for hormone regulation. Speaking of hormones, I've noticed that my facial hair grows back pretty quickly, especially above my lips and on my chin.

Throbbing pain or sensitivity in a root canal treated tooth is an indication of re-infection in it.

Hey there, doctor! My little 2-month-old baby girl has been dealing with a pesky cold for the past four days. She's been coughing a bit here and there, and her nose seems to be a bit stuffy and wheezy.

Hey doc, what's good? My little man, he's 4 years old, took a tumble in the playground and ended up with a broken left arm.

Hi doctor,

My son, who is 4 years old, fell in the play area and fractured his left arm (ulna and radius). We rushed to the ER and the doctors did alignment and put him in a cast and sling. I have attached the X-rays before and after the alignment for your reference. However, I noticed that in the X-ray after alignment, one of the bones was not properly aligned. The doctor assured me that it is normal for children to have a slight misalignment (up to 20%) and it will not affect the healing process. Can you please take a look and confirm if everything is okay?

I am also concerned because my son is not used to wearing a sling and he keeps taking it off while playing with his toys at home. Will this delay the healing process? Do children always need to wear a sling while in a cast? I would appreciate your advice on this matter.

Thank you for your time and expertise. Looking forward to your response.

Hey doc, mi hijo de 4 años se cayó en el área de juegos y se fracturó el brazo izquierdo (cúbito y radio). Fuimos a la sala de emergencias y los médicos lo alinearon y le pusieron un yeso y una férula. Adjunto las radiografías antes y después de la alineación. En la radiografía después de la alineación, uno de los huesos no estaba alineado correctamente. El médico dijo que está bien si está alineado más del 20% en niños.

Además, como tiene 4 años, no se está quedando con la férula todo el tiempo y mientras juega (con juguetes dentro de la casa), la férula se afloja.

This would take some weeks time to resolve. I suggest you take an oral Biotin supplement like tablet Revilus once a day for six months. In addition, I suggest you use a serum Q-sera serum. Use it on scalp skin, twice daily. Take care. ","

Hey doc,

So, I've been using cocaine for about six months now, but for the past four months, I've been dealing with this annoying cough and phlegm situation, especially in the mornings. My throat doesn't hurt or anything, it just feels kinda itchy. I went to see a doctor and they gave me this allergy spray with Cortizon, but I only used it for a month.

I went to see another doctor and they did all these tests, and everything came back clean. But, I did end up getting a bacterial infection in my throat, so now I'm doing salt and hot water gargling to try and clear it up.

So, I had this one time, like two weeks ago, where I coughed up some blood. And now, I got these red bumps on my neck. I'm feeling pretty weak, you know?

Hey there, doctor! I wanted to check in with you about something that's been on my mind. About two weeks ago, I coughed up some blood just once, and now I've noticed some red pimples on my neck. I've also been feeling pretty weak lately. I used to use tobacco about a year ago, but I've since gone through rehab and quit. I've been doing some research and it seems like these could be signs of cancer. Can you give me some insight on this? Thanks so much.",White

"Hello doctor,My husband has an eye infection for the past two months. The doctors diagnosed that it is a fungal infection pythium keratitis. This infection might be from crops.

"Hello doctor,I am having brown spotting with blood clots, and there is no pain or cramps. I had my periods in the first week of June.

"Hello doctor,I flossed by a tooth where a filling almost came out and my tooth and gum have been hurting all night. Also have a tooth that is by this molar that fell or chipped out.

If the pain is sharp, lancinating and referring to the same side jaw, temple, ear or throat, then this could be from the tooth with the chipped out filling. Most chipped out fillings expose the underlying nerve which causes severe pain. Ideally an X-ray is required to determine the depth of the cavity and to check for nerve involvement. If the nerve is involved, a root canal treatment and crown procedure will be done to save that tooth. If the pain is from the gums and is dull in nature, this could be an accidental gum injury due to flossing or there is a chance of the attempted food deposit to get deeply pushed into the gums causing this pain. If this is the case, a deep localized scaling should be performed under local anaesthesia to relieve any deeply wedged food deposit. A clinical examination and X-ray is required to diagnose the cause of this pain. I see that taking painkillers and topical anaesthetic in this situation were not much of help to you.

I've been taking homeopathic medicines for it, but unfortunately, in the last six to seven months, I've noticed new patches appearing on my face. It's becoming quite a serious issue as these spots seem to be spreading rapidly. I was wondering if you could recommend a fast and effective treatment for this problem. Thank you.",Asian

Kindly suggest some quick and efficient treatment.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. It is vitiligo and since new patches are appearing it is called unstable vitiligo. How many patches are there over your body other than your neck? I suggest you try using the following: You should consider visiting a dermatologist because treatment for vitiligo takes time for repigmentation and since new patches are appearing, oral steroid or Azathioprine can be considered after examination and blood investigations. Please visit a dermatologist, and it is better to take treatment at this stage before other body parts are involved. "," Hey doc, I got these little white dots on my legs for like two years now.

Can you hook me up with some fast and effective treatment? Gracias.",Latino

Hey there, doc! So, I've been dealing with these pesky little white spots on my legs for about two years now. I've been trying out some homeopathic remedies, but unfortunately, they haven't been doing the trick. And to make matters worse, in the past six to seven months, I've noticed some new patches popping up on my face. It's getting pretty concerning, and I'm hoping you can recommend a fast and effective treatment for me. Thanks in advance!",White

Hello doctor,

I recently found out that I have a dentigerous cyst and compound odontoma in my lower gums. The dentist recommended that I have the cyst removed and a biopsy done for the odontoma. Thankfully, I haven't experienced any pain or swelling.

A few months ago, I went to a dentist and we noticed a dark spot on my X-ray. It turned out to be an odontoma with an unerupted canine. We confirmed this with a CBCT scan, which also showed the presence of the dentigerous cyst. Now, I'm feeling quite anxious about the surgery, especially since it will be done under general anesthesia. I'm wondering if it's really necessary to remove the cyst?

I've consulted with a few surgeons and they all seem to have different opinions. One oral surgeon is suggesting that I have the cyst, odontoma, and a plate placed on the canine removed. Another surgeon is recommending just removing the cyst and odontoma. And then there's a dentist who advised me to wait and see since I don't have any symptoms. I've attached my reports for your reference. I would greatly appreciate your advice on this matter. Thank you.",Asian

They want to remove the cyst and do a biopsy on the odontoma. The thing is, I don't have any pain or swelling, so I'm not sure if it's really necessary.

A few months ago, I went to another dentist and we saw a dark spot on my X-ray. Turns out it was the odontoma, and it's blocking an unerupted canine. We did a CBCT scan and it confirmed the cyst and odontoma. Now, I'm just worried about the surgery, especially since they want to do it under general anesthesia.

I've talked to a few surgeons and they all have different opinions. One wants to remove the cyst, odontoma, and put a plate on the canine. Another just wants to remove the cyst and odontoma. And then there's a dentist who says I should just wait and see since I don't have any symptoms. I've attached my reports for you to take a look at. What do you think?",White
"Hello doctor,I am 28 years old. I got pregnant three months back. At 1.5 months, I went for a regular check-up. Everything came normal except for my TSH level, which came out to be 5.57.

Hi doctor,

I'm 28 years old and I recently found out I'm pregnant. At 1.5 months, I went for a regular check-up and everything seemed fine except for my TSH level, which was 5.57. This was my first time getting a thyroid test. The doctor diagnosed me with hypothyroidism and prescribed 50 mg of Thyronorm to be taken daily. After one month, I got my tests done again and my TSH level had dropped to 1.67, but I also tested positive for anti-TPO antibodies with a count of 278. Can you please explain what this means? Will I have to take medication for the rest of my life? And will it have any negative effects on my twins, who I am currently expecting? The doctor advised me to continue taking the medication even after delivery. What does this mean? Thank you for your help.",Asian

Hey doc,

I just got my upper belly ultrasound results and I'm a bit concerned. The report says the scan wasn't great because of gas in my bowels and my habit of lying on my side.

So I just got my upper belly ultrasound results back and they're saying it wasn't the best scan. Apparently, my bowels were gassy and my organs were all squished up under my ribs.

Hey there, doctor! So, I recently got an upper abdominal ultrasound and the report was a bit concerning.

"Hi doctor,Recently, I did an ECG. The doctor examined me and told me that I have a mild blockage. Please suggest.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

I have a question about my cataract surgery. The cataract seems to be falling into my vitreous. Will I need to have a vitrectomy surgery to remove the lens from the vitreous? My doctor also mentioned that I have an infection caused by streptococcus bacteria, called endophthalmitis. They have been giving me multiple antibiotic injections for it. My retina seems to be attached and my eye pressure is at 13. However, my cornea has hypopyon and my iris is cloudy, making it difficult for me to see clearly. My doctor is suggesting a cornea transplant and vitrectomy. What do you think? Thank you.",Asian
"Hi doctor,What is the next step done after cataract surgery when the cataract is falling into vitreous? Does it require vitrectomy surgery to recover lens from vitreous followed by streptococcus bacteria causing endophthalmitis infection and multiple antibiotic injections? The doctor examined and told me that my retina looks attached and my pressure is 13. My cornea has hypopyon. My iris has opacity, and I can see only a distorted and lighted background. My doctor recommends a cornea transplant for viewing and vitrectomy. Please suggest.","Hi. The lens falling into vitreous followed by endophthalmitis requires intravitreal antibiotic injections, and if the patient\s visual acuity deteriorates further, then vitrectomy is necessary. Regarding the corneal transplant, it is usually done in a disease entity called bullous keratopathy. But it can also be done for a variety of other reasons. Endophthalmitis is a very troublesome problem and needs a lot of patient cooperation with medication compliance and follow-ups.  Take care."," Hey doc, so I had cataract surgery and now the cataract is falling into my vitreous. Do I need to get a vitrectomy to get the lens out and then deal with this streptococcus bacteria that's causing an endophthalmitis infection? My doctor checked me out and said my retina is good and my pressure is at 13. But my cornea has this hypopyon thing going on. And my iris is all cloudy, so I can only see light and shapes. My doc is saying I might need a cornea transplant to see better and also a vitrectomy. What do you think?",Latino

Hey there, doc! I was wondering, what's the next step after cataract surgery if the cataract falls into the vitreous? Would I need a vitrectomy to remove the lens from the vitreous, especially if there's a risk of endophthalmitis infection from streptococcus bacteria? My doctor checked and said my retina is attached and my pressure is at 13. But my cornea has hypopyon and my iris is cloudy, so my vision is pretty distorted and hazy. The doc suggested a cornea transplant and vitrectomy. Any thoughts on that?",White
"Hi doctor,I have a small freckle about 3-4 mm on the side of my foot. It is not different from my skin in appearance. It just seems to be a brown blemish.

The brown spot on your foot could be a mole or lentigine (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as it has been there for long. They are just harmless. You need not worry unless you have a change in its size and color or a family history of skin cancer.

"Hello doctor,I am an 18-year-old, and I have experienced forgetfulness ever since I was in elementary. I usually ace my tests because I have a very short term memory, so cramming often makes do.

"Hello doctor,Is there a difference in alcoholic and non-alcoholic mouthwash. Which is better at combating bad breath due to smoking than alcoholic?

You must consult your psychiatrist for your anxiety and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) issues. You can also benefit from avoiding caffeinated beverages and alcohol if at all. So as regards the thyroid function test just keep repeating it regularly. I hope this helps. ","Hey doc,

So, I've been dealing with some pretty intense anxiety and OCD lately. It's been coming and going for a while now, and I just found out that my mom had the same thing. She was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid and some autoimmune thyroid thing, and once she started taking meds for it, her mental health issues went away.

I got my thyroid levels checked recently, and everything was normal except for my FT3, which was a little high at 8.97 pmol/L. I'm wondering if these occasional spikes in my FT3 could be causing my anxiety, depression, and OCD. I'm currently taking 150 mg of Sertraline, but with my mom's history, I'm not sure what to make of these results. What do you think? Is there a connection between my elevated FT3 and my mental health issues? And what should I do next? Could this be the reason my anxiety keeps flaring up?",White
"Hi doctor,I recently met an accident and I was wearing a helmet and it was ripped off in two meters and then for around five meters, I was without a helmet. Then after that moment I fell down and saw some lines and web like things. I consulted three doctors and every one is saying that there is no problem in my eyes. So, I even took a brain scan and the result is nothing and this is the third day. Even now I have not got any change. I am still seeing the lines and all. Can you please suggest anything for this? I am highly worried.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. This condition is called eye floaters, this might be a benign condition but in your case, as it popped up just suddenly after eye trauma, I would be going to an eye specialist, as this might be a sign of vitreous or retinal detachment or inflammation in the posterior part of the eye. CT scan will not show anything but they need to do retinoscopy. Let me know if you have any other questions. ","

"Hello doctor,About six weeks ago, I had protected sex with a male. About two weeks later, I developed a cold, which got better.

Protected sex is safe and there is no risk of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Having cold or flu is not a specific symptom or sign of HIV.

"Hello doctor,For the past three weeks, I have had my normal right eye floaters seem strange. I noticed peripheral flashes when blinking and walking and quick black narrow lines. I saw an ophthalmologist. He found the retina to be fine. I now have some flashes around peripheral in the right eye and a new large annoying floater, no curtain or loss of vision. Talked to an ophthalmologist last night. Said not to move eyes much. Should I go to ER? No vision loss. Just flashes and fast moving stringy floaters and flashes when moving eyes and walking.","Hi. The hollow of the eye is filled with vitreous jelly. With aging, the jelly starts to liquify and separates from its attachments to the retina. This results in a little tug on the retina, resulting in flashes. This phenomenon is known as posterior vitreous detachment or PVD in short. The large floater appears when the PVD is complete, that is, it detaches from its final strong attachment on the optic nerve head in the retina. What you are experiencing is normal aging of the vitreous jelly. Now in this process, sometimes breaks may form in the retina leading to floaters. Floaters may be due to the cells from the back of the retina gaining access to the vitreous cavity through the breaks in the retina. Sometimes floaters may result when the break involves a retinal blood vessel. It is extremely important to get a dilated fundus examination done on an urgent basis to rule out any of the breaks. If found, they can be lasered to prevent further progression to complete retinal detachment. So kindly do see a retina specialist. Let me know how it went. Take care. ","

Laryngomalacia usually gets corrected around eight months of age. Sometimes calcium levels are low which can result in stridor like sound, so calcium level should be done in the child. If low, then calcium needs to be started.  ","

Hey doc,

So, I had unprotected sex about 18 hours ago and I'm kinda freaking out. I'm already on meds for PCOD for a year now and it's been getting better. My period is supposed to come in a day or two. I'm 22, weigh 63 kg and I'm 4'11"". Do you think I should take the I-pill? Will it have any serious long-term effects? And will it make my PCOD worse? Also, can you suggest some other safe contraceptive methods besides the usual ones? I had an ultrasound of my lower abdomen four months ago and the doc found some small cysts. Thanks in advance for your help.",Asian

About 10 days later, I had some blood discharge for three days. My period was supposed to come between the 19th and 24th of this month, but it's been delayed. I took a home pregnancy test and it came back negative. I still haven't gotten my period, so is it delayed? What could be causing it? When can I expect it to come? Is there a chance I could be pregnant?",Latino
"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old female. I had unprotected intercourse with my partner the day after my periods end and consumed an i-pill on the same day. I had a blood discharge after 10 days and it was there for three days. I expected my period dates to be between 19th to 24th of this month but my periods were delayed. So I did a home pregnancy test and it is negative, and till now I have not got my periods, are they delayed? What may be the cause? When can I expect my periods? Are there chances of pregnancy?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Taking i-pill during the first half of the period cycle results in early periods. The three days of bloody discharge you had was actually a light period which came earlier due to the i-pill. So, now expect your next period around a month after that bleed. No need to worry it is very unlikely that you are pregnant. ","

"Hello doctor,My friend had accidentally swallowed tooth crown an hour ago, she is not facing any problem till now, what should she do, kindly advise.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern but I think as so much time has already passed and by God\s grace everything is fine then I think it has not gone into the airway, problem erupts only when it gets stuck in the airway, it might have gone down through the digestive tract and shall pass out normally through faeces. The biggest question is whether it went inside along with breath or food? That will surely subside the confusion and the one who swallowed most probably can feel this.

You may be aware that Risperidone (a dopamine antagonist) is prescribed as an antipsychotic and also helps to stabilize mood whereas Wellbutrin (Bupropion- norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) is used as an antidepressant. You need to be monitored for any potential side effects when you are taking a combination of these two medications. So kindly follow up with your prescribing doctor who will be able to review and titrate the dose accordingly.

Hey doc,

So, I had these two crazy episodes last year and got diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. They put me on Risperidone (1 mg) and Wellbutrin (150 mg) together. But like, one blocks dopamine and the other boosts it, right? So, wouldn't they just cancel each other out? Just wondering, thanks.",Asian

Muscle soreness or DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) generally occurs if someone does strenuous physical activity in any form.

It occurs due to small scale damage in the muscle fibers. The best way to get rid of it is to increase any physical activity gradually because it will help in increasing the strength and stamina. Epsom salt bath, massage or sauna, etc. are helpful in muscle soreness because first they relax the muscles and second they increase the blood flow.

"Hello doctor,I have been trying to conceive for one year. I am 30 years old. I have children already. Tracking BBT and LH to determine ovulation days (which I have found my peak). I had lots of irregular periods with 20-day cycles. Last cycle was 26 days. I want to try Clomid because I believe I may be having problems with the release of eggs. Please help.","Hello. Before opting for ovulation induction in your case, it would be important to learn if your partner\s semen analysis is normal on the first hand. Your cycle seems to be regularly irregular, which is often seen in cases of women with estrogen deficiency and the ones with progesterone deficiency. As you have mentioned that your thyroid is normal, but my primary concern with regards to ovulation remains the estradiol levels, FSH, LH, AMH, serum testosterone on day 3 of your cycle and serum progesterone on day 21 of your cycle. Without having these reports handy, it would not be recommended to opt for Clomiphene citrate to induction ovulation.

Before opting for ovulation induction in your case, it would be important to learn if your partner\s semen analysis is normal on the first hand. Your cycle seems to be regularly irregular, which is often seen in cases of women with estrogen deficiency and the ones with progesterone deficiency. As you have mentioned that your thyroid is normal, but my primary concern with regards to ovulation remains the estradiol levels, FSH, LH, AMH, serum testosterone on day 3 of your cycle and serum progesterone on day 21 of your cycle.

Hi doctor,

I'm 30 years old and have been trying to have a baby for a year now. I already have children, but I'm having trouble conceiving again. I've been keeping track of my basal body temperature and LH levels to figure out my ovulation days, and I've noticed that I have a peak. However, my periods have been pretty irregular with cycles lasting only 20 days. Last month was a bit longer at 26 days. I'm thinking of trying Clomid because I suspect that I may have issues with releasing eggs. Can you please offer some guidance? Thank you.",Asian

"Hello doctor, I would like to know what happens biologically in the body, causing a burning sensation in the tongue when a person has HIV.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

"Hello doctor,I am experiencing lower back pain, and it hurts whenever I stand up. I am also suffering from abdominal pain. I do not know if my period is the one that caused it.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Sometimes these symptoms can be due to periods in young females, so your gynecologist should be able to give you an insight into this. As far as lower back pain is concerned, if it has been present for a long time even in the absence of your periods time, then it could be due to a spinal issue. If you have localized back pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesias, etc., then you can start with following recommendations for an initial period of two to three weeks. 1. To maintain a proper posture of your back while working and sleeping. 2. If pain is more, then you can take a short course of anti-inflammatory medication like tab Ibuprofen or Paracetamol or one which suits you. 3. Physical therapy initially under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist and then to continue at home. 4. Adequate calcium and vitamin d intake if levels are low in the body. 5. Ice packs can be applied if your pain is acute, then hot fomentation can be done at home. 6. Analgesic spray for a local application can be used and is readily available. 7. Avoid lifting heavyweight and acute forward bending in mornings etc. We will observe you for the next two to three weeks how you respond to this conservative management protocol. If you are not feeling better, then we will have to get some investigations like, dynamic x-rays of lower back and few blood tests for evaluation.

Hey doc,

So, me and my girl had some unprotected action, but we were responsible and took an I-pill afterwards. But now she's noticing some changes in her body and we're not sure if it's from the medicine or if she might be preggers. Can you help us out? Gracias.",Latino

"Hi doctor,My chickenpox started seven days back. The fever has subsided now.I had been taking:Azithromycin,Acivir 400 DT,Cetzine,vitamin E capsule and,applying Calamine only on spots.A few spots are getting covered with a crust. What should I use at this stage to avoid scars? Looking at the pictures, will it leave any scar? How long will it take to go away?","Hello. Chickenpox takes around two weeks to get scabbed off. Since as per your query, if it already formed a crust, then now it will scab off soon. Do not touch it or scratch it. Otherwise, there will be high chances for scars on the face. The treatment you were taking is entirely correct, and you need not apply any particular thing on that. Wait for a few days more around a week to get rid of them. As per your photos, I do not think that they may leave a scar. Just you be careful not to touch or scratch. ","

Hello doctor,

I have a problem with my right tooth. It's been infected and I had a filling done two years ago. But now, the infection has spread to the roots and it's causing a lot of discomfort. I can't even use the right side of my mouth because of this issue. Can you please advise me on what to do? Thank you.",Asian

Hey there, doctor! I'm having some trouble with my right tooth. It's been infected for a while now, even though I got a filling done about two years ago.

"Hello doctor,I would like to know the best treatment for advanced keratoconus after using scleral lenses as well. Will there be a condition, where I do not have to use lenses like ever?","Hello. I understand your concern. There are a number of different treatments for keratoconus based on the corneal topographical measures and your visual needs. The best to halt progression is corneal collagen cross-linking (C3R). This procedure causes the development of a lot of chemical bonds inside your cornea stabilizing it, thus preventing it from bulging out further. This procedure can only bring stabilization and will not improve your vision. For vision, we have a number of surgeries and implants, which can improve vision after corneal collagen cross-linking. In case you need more information regarding the specific treatment suitable for your eyes, please send me a scanned copy for your topography reports along with your present glass power and doctors reports.

"Hello doctor,I would like to know the best treatment for advanced keratoconus after using scleral lenses as well. Will there be a condition, where I do not have to use lenses like ever?","Hello. I understand your concern. There are a number of different treatments for keratoconus based on the corneal topographical measures and your visual needs. The best to halt progression is corneal collagen cross-linking (C3R). This procedure causes the development of a lot of chemical bonds inside your cornea stabilizing it, thus preventing it from bulging out further. This procedure can only bring stabilization and will not improve your vision. For vision, we have a number of surgeries and implants, which can improve vision after corneal collagen cross-linking. In case you need more information regarding the specific treatment suitable for your eyes, please send me a scanned copy for your topography reports along with your present glass power and doctors reports. I will do my best to explain the pros and cons and guide you regarding the best course of action.  Take care.","

"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old. I am married. I have a bit problem in my sexual life. Whenever I insert my penis in her vagina she told me that when I insert full penis in her she feels pain. Is it normal or not?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Painful penetration in women may be caused by any injury or lacerations in vaginal walls, infection of the genital tract, forceful or violent sex, lack of lubrication in the vagina. I think you should do a lot of foreplay before penetration so that her vagina may get lubricated naturally. Also, it is highly recommended to use a water-based lubricant like KY jelly. Always be gentle to your partner while having sex. That is the key. ","

Antibodies are the proteins produced by the body in response to fight the foreign substance (antigen, virus, infectious agent) it enters the body. When antigen enters the body, it stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. It is very difficult to tell that how much time a particular person takes to develop antibodies. Your negative HIV antibody test at 120 days means that 99.9% of your body has not been exposed to HIV. The test kits used these days are highly sensitive and specific and give accurate results.120 days HIV negative test is highly conclusive of your negative HIV status. But, I think that you are not letting it go. The symptoms are more likely due to stress. There are very rare cases reported in the literature where the person has been exposed to antigen but the time taken by the body to produce detectable antibodies was longer, up to six months. There are recommendations and I also suggest to my patients to repeat the test at six months and if that will be negative you need not repeat it further. I hope this helps. ","

Antibodies are the proteins produced by the body in response to fight the foreign substance (antigen, virus, infectious agent) it enters the body. When antigen enters the body, it stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. It is very difficult to tell that how much time a particular person takes to develop antibodies. Your negative HIV antibody test at 120 days means that 99.9% of your body has not been exposed to HIV. The test kits used these days are highly sensitive and specific and give accurate results.120 days HIV negative test is highly conclusive of your negative HIV status. But, I think that you are not letting it go. The symptoms are more likely due to stress. There are very rare cases reported in the literature where the person has been exposed to antigen but the time taken by the body to produce detectable antibodies was longer, up to six months. There are recommendations and I also suggest to my patients to repeat the test at six months and if that will be negative you need not repeat it further. I hope this helps. ","
Hey doc, how's it going? I'm a 22-year-old guy and I've been dealing with some symptoms lately that got me worried. I got tested for HIV 1 and 2, and also did a tridot test, all came back negative at 120 days. But I've been experiencing symptoms since day 10. Is that enough time for my body to develop antibodies? I took the test six months ago and I'm still stressing about it. Can HIV be controlled or will it kill me? I've been gaining weight and noticed stretch marks and pimples on my body, plus headaches. And my eyes have this little red dot from a broken blood vessel. Should I get tested again or can I finally relax? Thanks for any info, I'm really anxious about this.",Latino

Hey there, doc! I'm a 22-year-old and I've been experiencing all the symptoms of HIV. I got tested for HIV 1 and 2, as well as a tridot test, and they all came back negative at 120 days. But I've been having symptoms since day 10. Can I trust the results of my 120-day test? I actually got tested six months ago and I'm still really worried about having HIV. Is it a deadly virus or can it be managed like a regular one? And is the 120-day test really accurate?

Hey doc,

So I was feeling some pain on the left side of my chest and I went to see the cardiologist. He told me to get an echo 2D and TMT done. I got the results and here's what they said:

Everything in my heart is normal size-wise. No funky stuff going on with the walls or anything like that. My left ventricle is pumping like it should be, with an LVEF of 60%. But I do have some grade 2 diastolic dysfunction in the LV. There's a little bit of MR and TR, with a RVSP of 25mmHg and RAP. Oh, and some trace PR too. But no fluid build-up around my heart, thank goodness. And no weird masses or clots or anything like that.

My IVC is looking good too, with a normal size and collapsing at 50% (which I guess means my RAP is at 5 mmHg). And the exercise test came back negative for any signs of heart trouble.

So yeah, that's the scoop on my heart situation. Any thoughts, doc?",African American

Hi doctor,

I was experiencing some discomfort on the left side of my chest, so I went to see a cardiologist. After some tests, the doctor recommended an echo 2D and TMT. I have the report here:

All my cardiac chambers are normal in size, and there are no abnormalities in regional wall motion. My LV systolic function is also normal, with an LVEF of 60%. However, I do have grade 2 LV diastolic dysfunction. There is also a trace of MR and TR (with an RVSP of 25mmHg+RAP) and PR. But the good news is, there is no pericardial effusion, intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation.

My IVC is also normal in size, and it collapses 50% (which indicates an RAP of 5 mmHg). And the exercise test came back negative for any reversible myocardial ischemia.

Thank you for taking the time to review my report, doctor. I appreciate your expertise and guidance in this matter.",Asian

"Hello doctor,Last night I ate a cheese pizza and a chocolate bar.

My question is, do I have diabetes or did I initially have high sugar because I ate pizza very late at night?","Hello. Usually fasting blood glucose is 126 mg and above is considered as diagnostic for diabetes. However, it is also possible that because of the dinner, fasting glucose might have shown a higher level. So to confirm whether there is diabetes or not, you may have to get a PP (postprandial) glucose level and HbA1c %. If PP is 200 mg and above and HbA1c % 6.5 % and above, then diabetes is considered to confirm. Looking at your weight and height, another important fact is with a BMI of 42.92 kgs/Sq meter you are already in grade 3 obesity. With a significant amount of excess weight. This itself is an invitation for getting diabetes. ","

Usually fasting blood glucose is 126 mg and above is considered as diagnostic for diabetes. However, it is also possible that because of the dinner, fasting glucose might have shown a higher level. So to confirm whether there is diabetes or not, you may have to get a PP (postprandial) glucose level and HbA1c %. If PP is 200 mg and above and HbA1c % 6.5 % and above, then diabetes is considered to confirm. Looking at your weight and height, another important fact is with a BMI of 42.92 kgs/Sq meter you are already in grade 3 obesity. With a significant amount of excess weight. This itself is an invitation for getting diabetes. ","
Hey doc, qué tal? So last night I indulged in a cheesy pizza and a chocolate bar. But this morning, after fasting for eight hours, I checked my blood sugar and it was at 128. Then, just 30 minutes later, it dropped to 106, and 15 minutes after that it went up to 109 (and I didn't eat or drink anything in between). So, mi pregunta es, do I have diabetes or was it just the late-night pizza that spiked my sugar levels? Gracias.",Latino

Hey doc,

So last night, I indulged in a delicious cheese pizza and a chocolate bar. But this morning, after fasting for eight hours, I tested my blood sugar and it was at 128. Then, about 30 minutes later, it dropped to 106, and 15 minutes after that, it went up to 109 without me eating or drinking anything.

So I've been dealing with hypothyroidism for a good 24 years now. And on top of that, I also have Sjogren's syndrome, but thankfully no autoimmune thyroid issues.

I even started sleeping for like 20 hours straight on the weekends. But my doctor was still saying my TSH levels were too high, so she lowered the dosage again to .125 mcg. And that's when things really went downhill for me. I was feeling exhausted all the time, gaining even more weight, and my joints were just screaming in pain.

So, my GGT levels are still high even though I stopped drinking. And just so you know, I used to only drink once a week, and not even that much (just 90 ml). What's going on with that? Can you give me some insight? Gracias.",Latino
"Hello doctor,Serum GGT levels are elevated despite giving up alcohol. Even before, the frequency of drinking was maximum once in a week (90 ml). What does this imply? Please help.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There are a few questions regarding your health and lifestyle that would help in finding the answers to your query. 1. Have you had any jaundice recently or ever? 2. How long have you been taking alcohol? 3. Is there anyone in the family (siblings, parents) who has had liver problems? 4. Have you lost weight, how is your appetite? The reports are from last month, do you have any reports from before this (attachment removed to protect patient identity)? Have you done viral markers, like hepatitis C and B? The report shows raised GGT, but in your query, you had mentioned about gall bladder stones, but the report of ultrasound is KUB, which does not mention anything about liver, gall bladder or bile ducts. There are no reports of CBC (complete blood count) as well. Please do a repeat CBC, full ultrasound of abdomen (to look for gall stones and bile duct) and send. ","
Hey there, doctor! So, I recently got my blood work done and it turns out my Serum GGT levels are still high, even though I've completely cut out alcohol. And just to give you some context, I used to drink about 90 ml once a week at most. I'm a bit confused about what this could mean, so I was hoping you could shed some light on it for me. Thanks in advance for your help!",White

Hi doctor,

I had a problem with my ear two months ago. It had a hole in it, but it was healing nicely. The doctor told me to clean it with ear syringing. He did it twice and also cleaned out the earwax.

Hey there doc,

So, about two months ago, I had a little mishap with my ear. It ended up getting perforated, but thankfully it was healing up nicely. My doctor recommended using an ear syringe to clean it out, and I got two rounds of that done. Then, they did a little earwax clean up. But now, my ear is not doing so hot. It feels like my eardrum has hardened up or something. When I try to pop it by putting my finger in my ear, it doesn't budge at all. It's like it's stuck in one spot.

"Hello doctor,The last few days my wife says that she feels sick. After that, I took my wife to the doctor.

It is a case of a mild form of hemolytic anemia. In that case, the ferritin level might not be raised. Along with low ferritin, your red blood cells count is also low.

Hi doctor,

My wife has been feeling unwell for the past few days, so I took her to see a doctor. The doctor recommended some tests, including HB electrophoresis, ferritin, TSH, PPBS, USG lower abdomen, CBC, PBF, and a urine test.

The results came back with a Hb% of 10.2, platelet count of 266000, RBC count of 4.28, WBC count of 7300, MCV of 74, HCT/PCV of 32%, TSH level of 4.39, normal urine, 1-2 pus cells, 1-3 epithelial cells, PPBS of 5.9, and a normal USG. However, the ferritin level was lower than normal at 10.98 ng/ml, and the HB electrophoresis showed Hb A at 71.3%, Hb E at 25.3%, and HbA2 at 3.4%.

The doctor mentioned that my wife has a blood disorder called Hemoglobin E trait. Can you please explain this report to me?

Hi doctor,

I'm 32 years old and I just had a baby two months ago. I'm having some trouble with hard bowel movements and I've noticed some bleeding. I've been taking Anuloma DS tablets, but I'm worried about stopping them because then my bowel movements become hard again and the bleeding returns. My baby is still small, so I'm not sure if it's safe to keep taking the medicine regularly. Can you please advise me on what to do? Thank you so much for your help.",Asian

Hi doctor,

I have a concern and I hope you can help me out. Last month, on the 18th and 19th, I had unprotected intercourse with my partner. It was the day after my period ended. On the 21st, I took an i-pill because my partner wasn't sure if he had ejaculated inside me. However, he also ejaculated outside. Now, my period is supposed to come on the 17th of this month, but it's already late. I'm 22 years old and my periods are usually regular. I did experience some spotting for five days about a week after taking the i-pill. I'm wondering if there's a chance I could be pregnant or if my period is delayed due to hormonal changes.

Hey doc,

So, I had sex with my partner without using any protection on the 18th and 19th of last month. The 18th was actually the day after my period ended. I got a little worried because my partner wasn't sure if he had ejaculated inside me or not, so I took an i-pill on the 21st just to be safe. But, he also ejaculated outside too, just to give you the full picture.

Now, here's the thing - my period was supposed to come on the 17th of this month, but it hasn't shown up yet. I'm 22 and my periods are usually pretty regular, so this is definitely out of the ordinary for me. Also, about a week after taking the i-pill, I had some spotting for five days. Do you think there's a chance I could be pregnant, or is this just a case of my hormones being out of whack?",White

"Hello doctor,Recently I have been experiencing severe tooth pain and cannot reach a dentist at the moment. Due to the pain, I have been taking Advil. Yesterday I took three Advil, two at once and then waited eight hours to take one more. Today I have taken two Advil every eight hours for a total of six all together. Each Advil is 200 mg, so I was just wondering if I will be okay? I take Albuterol (asthma pump) before a workout or when needed.","Hello. In an emergency, if you have severe pain and take some painkiller then it is fine for temporary relief. But you should not take it as you have taken. If there is an infection causing your dental pain then your painkiller gives only symptomatic relief, but your dental infection will still be present. Excess intake of any medication (such as painkiller) may be harmful. Many dental pain needs treatment as well as medication. Only medication gives you symptomatic relief. So I recommend you to see your dentist to find out root cause and treatment. Do not take any medication without the advice of a registered practitioner.  Take care.","

"Hello doctor,I got married before a month, and we are unable to have sex because of my very hard hymen. Yesterday I got bleeding during sex, and we thought it broke, but it was like a small tear from the side. My husband\s penis is above average, and it is very hard, so I get unbearable pain every time, and he is unable to penetrate as I force him to stop. Is there any medicine to tear the hymen or only surgery is the option? Please help us.","Hello. I can understand your concern. Hymen will not be hard, and your partner needs to understand your vagina, proper foreplay will dilate the vaginal region for easy access. Ask your partner to masturbate for you and increase foreplay. The hymen does not generally break in the first penetrative sex. If your pain persists, it can be due to injury, wait for a week for the hymen to heal. If your pain persists, you can use a painkiller. Increase the foreplay time or masturbation will lubricate the vagina for less painful sex. Use K-Y gel (water based lunbricant), or painkillers if you have any doubts regarding masturbation and foreplay. If all these basic things are fine, we can think of other surgical causes. ","

So last month, I went to this doctor who had HIV and she gave me an injection in my vein without using gloves. And get this, she didn't even use cotton, she just used her finger to stop the bleeding. And then she rubbed my vein with her hands while it was still bleeding. I'm kinda worried, am I at risk?

I did an HIV DNA PCR test after 9 days, and then a fourth generation ELISA test after a month. But one of the doctors told me that the window period is actually 90-180 days. So now I'm wondering, what kind of test should I do after six months? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, doc.",Asian

There was no risk of HIV involved by the injection given by HIV infected doctor surgeon. Even if she touched with her finger at the bleeding site with the naked hand, you were not at risk. HIV cannot be transmitted by touching HIV infected person. Your risk was unwarranted in the scenario you mentioned. The test which you took, was highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. Window period is the time taken for antibodies to develop after infection and then to be detected by a particular test. 99.9% of the people who are infected with HIV develop HIV antibodies by three months. It is good that you know your HIV status now, you do not require any further test. I hope this helps. ","

Hey doc,

So last month, I had this doctor who had HIV give me an injection in my vein. And get this, she didn't even use gloves! And instead of using cotton, she just used her finger to stop the bleeding. And then, to top it off, she rubbed my vein with her bare hands while it was still bleeding. Can you believe it?

Anyway, I got pretty worried about it and went in for an HIV DNA PCR test after 9 days. And then, just to be safe, I did a fourth generation ELISA test after a month. But now I'm hearing that the window period for HIV testing is actually 90-180 days. So my question is, what kind of test should I get after six months? Thanks, doc.",White
"Hello doctor,What does it mean when you have hurt your foot? It is not swollen but it hurts.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Normally, when the foot is twisted, it is likely to have a soft tissue injury like sprain of the ligaments. If you have flat foot then minor twisting can also lead to hairline fracture and sprain. Although both the conditions will cause swelling, in your case no swelling is present but throbbing is a sign of inflammation. So, start anti-inflammatory treatment like Diclofenac 50 mg or Ibuprofe twice a day. Get an X-ray done to look for a repeat fracture. Use ice packs. Tie bandage under guidance of an expert as correct positioning is essential and pain relief sprays for local application. Give the foot adequate rest. ","

"Hello doctor,Is it possible to do birth control surgery also during C-section during delivery?","Hello. Yes, you can opt for tubal ligation during cesarean section but you have to give consent for the same prior to the cesarean. Usually, the doctor proceeds with the ligation only after the pediatrician confirms that the baby is doing fine. If not, then you are being informed on the table and the doctor usually avoids the procedure in good faith considering the condition of the neonate.

Any advice or help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",Asian
"Hi doctor,I suffer from severe constipation for the past three years. I have undergone cervical spine surgery before two years back. Post surgery constipation problem still got worsened. Presently, I am taking Baclofen 5 mg three times a day for the spasticity in legs. Please help.","Hi. The first option for treating constipation is starting with Sennosides tablets. Take two tablets every night. If there is no improvement in two days, you can take two tablets for every 12 hours. This medication can be taken for now and on. Sometimes you may need more fiber to make bulks in the stools. Psyllium Plantago is a natural laxative, and it helps for maintaining an adequate amount of fiber. You can take one tablespoon in a glass of water every morning and then  ChatDoctor.  You should take at least 1.5 liters of pure water every day. You can add milk of magnesia 15 to 25 ml for every eight hours until the stool gets soft. It has to be taken when there is bad constipation once in a while (two to three days for every ten days). "," Hey doc, I've been dealing with some serious constipation for like, three whole years now. And get this, I even had surgery on my neck like two years ago, but it didn't do squat to help with the constipation.

"Hello doctor,I suffered from a horrible panic attack this morning which lasted over 5 hours and along with it I got painful cramps in my stomach similar to contraction pains and really bad chest pains, it felt like someone has physically squeezed my heart and I have seen my doctor about this previously although my anxiety has not been this bad before but I am not sure what to do.

Hey doc,

I had a straight-up terrible panic attack this morning that lasted for over 5 hours. And let me tell you, it was no joke. Along with it, I was dealing with some serious cramps in my stomach that felt like straight-up contractions. And on top of that, my chest was feeling like it was being squeezed by a vise. It was like someone was physically messing with my heart, you know?

I've actually talked to my doctor about this before, but my anxiety has never been this bad. And now I'm at a loss for what to do. I've tried all sorts of meds, but none of them seem to do the trick except for Valium and Oxazipam. But my doc doesn't want to keep prescribing those because they can be addictive. And I get it, but at the same time, my anxiety is seriously messing with my life. I'm a young mom of two, and I need to be able to take care of my babies.

This morning, I had to call my mom to come over and help out because my anxiety was just too much to handle. And the worst part is, I have no idea why I even had a panic attack in the first place. It's like my body just decided to go haywire for no reason.

So yeah, that's where I'm at right now. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, doc.",African American

Hi doctor,

I had a really bad panic attack this morning that lasted for more than 5 hours. Along with it, I also experienced excruciating stomach cramps that felt like labor pains and intense chest pains that felt like someone was squeezing my heart.

Our physician told that I have some infection in the intestine and was advised to take antibiotic and pain killer. I got my uterus and ovaries removed 10 years ago. Actually, I have pain in the right side of the abdomen and around the navel. General surgeons feel that it might be a muscle spasm or some gynecological symptom. Please give your valuable suggestion.","Hi. Inflammatory. Contrast-enhanced CT scan and urinary culture. 1. Inflammatory.2. Infective.3. Neoplastic. I suggest an antimuscarinic agent such as Buscopan (Hyoscine butylbromide) or Mebeverine for symptomatic relief of pain along with your current painkillers. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Revert back with the answers to the above questions to a general surgeon online.- Take care.","
Hey there doc,

I'm a 55-year-old lady dealing with some gnarly stomach pain. My ultrasound came back all clear, but the CT scan showed a bit of free fluid in my pelvis. My doctor thinks it might be an intestinal infection and prescribed me some antibiotics and painkillers. Just to give you some background, I had my uterus and ovaries taken out a decade ago. The pain is mostly on my right side and around my belly button. The surgeons I've seen think it could be a muscle spasm or something related to my lady parts. Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!",White
"Hi doctor,My 19 months old daughter has suffered with for around seven months. Then, we had an MCU test and it was diagnosed that she had grade 5 reflux in right side and grade 4 in left side. Her ultrasound showed she had 40 cc urine residual. Her doctor suggested ureteric bilateral surgery. She has an open vascular surgery before two months and her stents removed before 20 days. Now, she again had an UTI and reflux problem. Is there any problem? Please guide us.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Surgery to correct reflux will not prevent UTI (urinary tract infection). It will only prevent bacteria from reaching kidneys, thereby preventing renal damage. Yes, UTI can still occur after correction of reflux. Other factors which predispose to UTI must be ruled out, like neurogenic bladder, voiding dysfunction, dysfunctional elimination syn ChatDoctor.  If there are no other factors, then the child can be put on prophylactic antibiotics for a few months and this will stop the recurrence. Best wishes for your child. "," Hey doc, what's good?

Hello doctor,

I am a worried parent of a 19-month-old daughter. She has been suffering from some urinary issues for the past seven months. We recently had an MCU test done and it revealed that she has grade 5 reflux on her right side and grade 4 on her left side. The ultrasound also showed that she has 40 cc of urine residual. Our doctor has recommended ureteric bilateral surgery for her. She had a vascular surgery two months ago and her stents were removed 20 days ago. However, she has now developed another UTI and the reflux problem persists. We are concerned and would appreciate your guidance on this matter. Thank you.",Asian

"Hello doctor,I am a female nearing 40. My partner and I are sexually very active. A year ago, I was diagnosed for PID, and pap smear revealed nothing else.

Hey doc,

I'm a 40-year-old lady and me and my boo are getting it on regularly. But about a year back, I got hit with PID and my pap smear didn't show nothing else.

But lately, I've been dealing with this excessive discharge, no funky smell or pus, just a white color. And my left labia is burning and my lower belly is hurting. No burning when I pee though. It's only after we do the deed that the burn kicks in. I don't use no fancy soaps, just a feminine wash. Is this PID again or something else? My man is good, we use protection during this time.

Hi doctor,

I'm a woman in my late 30s and my partner and I have a very active sex life. About a year ago, I was diagnosed with PID and my pap smear didn't show any other issues. We both got treated and everything was fine for a while. I'm a very clean person and always make sure to wash before and after sex. We also enjoy oral sex.

But recently, I've been experiencing a lot of discharge (it's white and doesn't have a smell or pus), a burning sensation on the tip of my left labia, and pain in my lower abdomen. I don't feel any burning when I pee, but it starts to burn after sex. I don't use scented soaps, but I do use a feminine wash. Do you think this could be PID again or something else? My partner is doing fine and we always use protection during sex. Can you recommend any medication and tell me what might be causing these symptoms? Thank you.",Asian

"Hello doctor,During my last eye exam, a couple days ago, my eye doctor stated I needed lab work drawn due to a drastic change in my eyes. The sphere was -3.25 bilateral two years back and now is -2.0 bilateral. What is the concern?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand that your eye power has changed quite a bit in two years. The change that we normally expect to see in you would be more on the minus side that is to say that your power must naturally progress to more on the minus side than becoming less. We see these changes occurring due to a process called nuclear sclerosis, which is part of the normal aging process of the lens inside your eye. Since the power has become lesser, this change cannot be simply ignored as due to aging and your doctor must be suspecting a cause for which he has asked for laboratory work. There are very few conditions which can cause such a change, to name a few progressive hypermetropia, retinal and choroid diseases.  ","

"Hi doctor,I need help. Two weeks ago, I was at a friend\s gathering or party. And we filled a barrel with glass bottle drinks and a lot of ice and a lot of water. Everyone picked up their drinks from the barrel. I had a cut on my finger and constantly dipped my hand in the barrel for a drink. I later got to know some colleagues at the party are HIV positive. But I did not see the water in the barrel bloody or anything of that sort. And I cannot tell if someone had cuts on their hands as well. A week after the incident, I got this mild cold. And I am worried. Please, is it possible for HIV to have survived in the water? Should it be the case that anyone had a cut on his or her hand? Is it possible to have gotten infected just like that? Please help me.","Hi. I have read your query carefully. You are tensed about your exposure to HIV. Now I am explaining you everything. HIV infection is usually acquired through sexual intercourse, exposure to infected blood, or perinatal transmission. In your case, you are exposed to HIV by blood mixing fluid to  ChatDoctor.  You have to keep in mind that the HIV virus does not survive for a long time outside the body. You also keep in mind that exposure through oral route is extremely rare. So there is very very little chance to be infected by this mean. But if you are worried after that explanation, you can go for a test named ELISA for HIV. But it needs minimum 2 to 3 weeks to be positive in the fourth generation test. And 7 to 8 weeks in the first generation ELISA todetect the virus after exposure. So you should wait. ","
Hey doc, I need some help. So, a couple weeks back, I was at my friend's shindig, right? And we had this big ol' barrel filled with glass bottle drinks, ice, and water. Everybody was grabbing their drinks from there, you know? But here's the thing - I had a little cut on my finger and I kept dipping my hand in the barrel for a drink. Now, here's where it gets real - turns out some of my coworkers at the party are living with HIV. But I didn't see no blood or nothing in the water, and I couldn't tell if anyone else had cuts on their hands. But now, a week later, I'm feeling under the weather. And I'm freaking out, man.

Treatment includes manual correction of ingrown hair (visit your dermatologist) under magnification. Your hairs have changed their direction due to pulling. Once pulled out, they will grow normally and will not cause redness and bumps within the skin. Go for laser hair removal, which will take care of both hair growth as well as ingrown hair. Make sure it is a laser and not an IPL (intense pulse light) device. Things can be normal if you start following the right path. I hope this answers your query. ","
Hey doc,

So, I've been dealing with this hair situation on my neck since I was like 12. It's been a real struggle, let me tell you. I've tried everything - pulling the hairs out with my fingers, digging at the skin with my nails, using razors, even tweezers. But now, my skin is looking rough. Like, real rough. It's all scarred up and I'm feeling self-conscious about it. I mean, I don't want my neck to look like a woman's, you know? And the hair just keeps growing back, bringing along those pesky bumps. I really want to clear up my skin and get rid of all these bumps and scars. Can you help me out, doc?",African American

"Hello doctor,I had a spinal fusion surgery down my entire back about two years ago when I was 17. I never had terrible back pain but as of recent, it is been somewhat bad.

Hey doc, I've been dealing with some intense pain for the past month. It's like a sharp, stabbing sensation that literally takes my breath away. And on top of that, my whole body is having spasms. It's really freaking me out. I've noticed some pulsing in my upper left side, right under my ribs. The pain starts in my back and then moves to the front with these cramps. I got my blood and urine checked, and everything came back normal. I even did an MRI, and it showed that my liver looks good with no weird spots. The gallbladder is also chill, and there's no blockage in my bile ducts. But I'm still confused about what it means if there's no blockage in my bile ducts. Can you break it down for me? Thanks, doc.",White

Hence, you need not be anxious. Basically, the foreskin slides easily during sex and one should not forget to pull it back after sex. So in essence, retractability of foreskin is not a deciding factor for sex. Do not worry and just enjoy. ","

My question is, does someone\s total protein count change significantly based on how much protein rich food they eat? Or does someone\s total protein count not change unless they have an illness like muscle damage? When I say total protein count I am referring to what is calculated in a biuret test.","Hi. The protein is digested in our human body but is sometimes excreted when not digested properly or in excess quantity. The term which you are referring to, which is total protein count in blood, urine and saliva has totally different meaning in all the three mediums. Total protein count in blood changes with increased protein ingestion and already present muscle protein or any other protein breakdown inside the body whereas protein in urine or any excretory product is always when the degradation of protein has increased, which can be possible because of higher intake of protein or increased muscle breakdown due to some pathology inside the body. I hope that I have answered your question. Let me know if you have any other doubts. ","
Hey there, doc! I've been wondering about something regarding the total protein count in blood, urine, and saliva. I'm curious, does a person's total protein count vary depending on how much protein they consume? Or does it only change if they have a condition like muscle injury? And just to clarify, I'm talking about the amount measured in a biuret test. Thanks for your help!",White
"Hello doctor,About six hours ago, I started seeing a transparent floater which I had not seen before, and then three hours later, I started seeing light flashes at the edge of my visual field in my left eye. Can I wait for three more days to see my doctor?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. If you have access to an ophthalmologist on this weekend, then get a thorough retinal evaluation with indentation done. The symptoms you are describing are consistent with posterior vitreous detachment, a process which by itself does not cause a decrease in vision. However, it can pull onto retina hence causing a retinal tear in the process. If that is present, it needs to be lasered within a day or two. If you do not have high myopia or have a family history of retinal detachment, then you are low-risk patient and can wait another two days if it is imperative. Physiological. Peripheral retinal evaluation. ","

"Hello doctor,Are Halloween colored contact lenses safe? Do people who need prescribed contact lenses be using them?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Ophthalmologists do not recommend colored contact lenses. However, they may be used occasionally for not more than a few hours. The reason is that compared to regular glasses, most colored lenses have a lesser tendency to allow oxygen to pass through to the corneas, thus causing damage to the corneal cells. This problem does not depend on whether the user is a prescription lens user or not. It depends on the quality of the lens and a few biological variables of the person using them. I hope this helps you. ","

By yesterday night, it moved down to where period cramps usually are. They are not cramps, but they do feel like cramps. It is present consistently and sore to press on my stomach on the both sides. I do not have a fever, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. What could be wrong?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There could be ureteric calculus if the pain is sharp and shooting or a renal stone dislodged from the place. You need to get an ultrasound done to rule out any pathology. It needs further physical examination as it could just even be a muscular spasm, which happens if there is a muscle pull during day-to-day activity or exercise. There could be an ovarian cyst as the site you specified looks near to the ovaries, but less likely as you are on a birth control pill.

Your post does not have many details, but I presume that you are seeking advice for someone who has been emotionally disturbed by some past traumatic event. Usually, people recover from emotional trauma with support and passage of time. It depends on the severity of symptoms and the trauma involved.

Try to distract them from pensive thoughts by joining in music, movies, plays, etc. Encourage them to go exercise regularly. Patience and perseverance are needed in helping them to recover. If the person continues to be mentally unstable despite family support, you can consult a doctor for further assessment of mental health and support accordingly. Take care. ","

Hey doc, what's up? I'm a 38-year-old dude with hypothyroidism and high cholesterol.

Now, do your rehabilitation and weight training properly as advised. You can start walking normally. The pain what you are referring could be due to muscle stiffness or soreness.

Hey doc, what's good? I'm 25 and I just had ACL surgery and meniscus repair on my left leg about three months ago. Right now, I'm in the middle of my post-op rehab and my doctor told me to take it easy and walk slow. I've been doing squats and lifting weights, but I'm wondering how much longer it's gonna take for me to walk and run like a regular person. Will I ever be able to get back to my old self in the next 10 days? I'm still feeling some pain around my knee cap, even though it's been three months since the surgery.

"Hi doctor,I am a 30 year old woman. I found blood in my stool this morning, for the first time in life. I am sure that is not period. Is it a sign of bowel cancer?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I assure you not to worry a lot as things can be settled with proper care and follow up. There are some reasons for fresh blood in stools, with stools, before or after stools other than menstrual blood.First of all, it may be hemorrhoids. You may have felt some dilated small lesions on the anal opening before or after passing stools ( if this was bleeding hemorrhoid). It is due to a disease named portal hypertension and you need to follow it up and it will settle down with treatment. Your general surgeon is the person to decide the stage of hemorrhoids and treatment goes accordingly. He may do proctoscopy, colonoscopy or digital rectal examination. The other cause is anal fissure bleed. When stools get hard due to constipation and when patient forcibly defecates, it causes a breach in the mucosal lining of the rectum and anus and it bleeds in the form of fresh blood. Lactulose syrup, whole grain foods, dietary fiber supplements, plenty of fluids and a good physical activity will help improve this condition. But it may also need treatment with antibiotics to avoid severe infection. General surgeon consultation for a physical examination is my suggestion. Last but not least is the cancerous growth. It is serious but less likely in your case. But if you have a family history of colon cancer, have a change in bowel habits, lost weight, loss in appetite, constipation or diarrhea, You may be having cancer. A general surgeon will diagnose with colonoscopy and barium tests through radiologic studies.

"Hello doctor,Yesterday, I had a colonoscopy and today I had a bowel movement that was bright green. Should I contact the doctor who performed the procedure or is this normal? I am a 32-year-old female.","Hi. Bright green color stool could be due to the presence of bile in stool. During a colonoscopy, you were given laxatives that might have disturbed your intestinal flora that is responsible for the yellowcolor of the stool. Also, stool must have passed rapidly through the gut. Other causes could be: 1. Fat rich diet will increase the release of bile pigments and if it moves rapidly, your stool will be green. It occurs during a period of stress or infections. 2. Rarely diet rich in green leafy vegetables can cause green color stools, if malabsorption ensues or due to not chewing properly. 3. If you have any other symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting or green stools, do not stop within the next 12 to 14 hours. Then I would suggest you consult your doctor. You can take probiotics to build up your intestinal flora. ","

Hey doc,

I've been dealing with some IBS symptoms and I think it might be related to SIBO. I was hoping you could give me some advice on how to effectively treat it. I've been experiencing leaky gut and multiple food intolerances, and my test results seem to indicate hydrogen sulfide based SIBO. Whenever I eat foods like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, or high protein foods, I have severe farting with a really unpleasant smell. It's been suggested that I may have an overgrowth of sulfate-reducing bacteria. I've tried taking Rifaximin, which helps with SIBO, but it's only temporary. Unfortunately, I have to stick to a rice-based diet because I can't eat gluten or wheat.

I've heard from some SIBO experts that the root cause of SIBO could be related to MMC or vagal nerve dysfunction. Apparently, increasing gut motility can help a lot of patients improve. So I was wondering if taking a prokinetic or cholinergic support could prevent SIBO from coming back. What do you think?",Asian

Hey doc,

So, I've been dealing with some IBS symptoms and I think it might be related to SIBO. I really need your advice on how to treat it effectively. Here's the deal: I've got a leaky gut or intestinal permeability and I'm dealing with multiple food intolerances. It seems like I've got hydrogen sulfide-based SIBO, which means I'm constantly farting and it smells pretty bad when I eat stuff like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and high protein foods. I've also got an overgrowth of sulfate-reducing bacteria going on. I've tried Rifaximin and it helps, but only temporarily. And to top it off, I can't eat gluten or wheat, so I'm stuck with rice as my main carb source.

I've been doing some research and some experts say that the root cause of SIBO could be MMC or vagal nerve dysfunction. Apparently, a lot of patients see improvement when they increase their gut motility. So, I was wondering if taking a prokinetic or cholinergic support could help prevent SIBO from coming back.

What do you think, doc? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",Latino

Hi there, doctor! I have a question for you. I have two teeth that are giving me some trouble, and I'm not sure which one is the culprit.

Hey doc,

So, I've been taking steroids on and off for like three years now. Last year, I had a scary episode of artial fibrallation, but thankfully it hasn't happened again. But when I went to the doctor recently, my blood pressure was through the roof at 152/90. They did some tests and said my LV (that's the left ventricle, right?) is normal and my LVEDD (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, in case you didn't know) is 53 mm. They also said my heart's systolic function is all good and there's no issues with the way my heart's walls are moving.

But here's the thing, they also found out I have LVH (that's left ventricular hypertrophy, in case you didn't know). It's at 14 mm, which I guess is not too bad, but they also said I have some diastolic dysfunction going on. My E/A ratio is 1 and my E/E' is between 8-15, whatever that means. And my LA (left atrium) is 21 cm^2. I'm not sure what all that means, but I'm guessing it's not good.

But here's the good news, doc. I've already lost 24 kg (that's like 53 lbs, in case you didn't know) and now I'm weighing in at 110 kg (that's 242 lbs) and I'm 194 cm tall (that's like 6'4"", in case you didn't know). My goal is to get down to 93 kg (that's 205 lbs) and I'm working hard to get there.

Oh, and one more thing. I stopped taking those steroids and now my blood pressure is looking much better at 123/75. So here's my question, doc. Will my diastolic function get better once I manage to reverse this LVH thing? I'm really hoping it will, 'cause I'm doing everything I can to get my heart back in tip-top shape. Thanks for your help, doc.",African American

Hey doc,

So, I've been taking steroids on and off for like three years now. And let me tell you, it's been a wild ride. Last year, I had this thing called artial fibrallation (never again, gracias a Dios). And when I went to the doctor, my blood pressure was through the roof - 152/90, can you believe it?

But here's the thing, my heart is actually pretty normal. My LV (that's left ventricle for all you non-medical folks) is all good, with a size of 53 mm and normal systolic function. No weird wall movements or anything like that. But I do have a little LVH (that's left ventricular hypertrophy, in case you didn't know). It's at 14 mm, which is not too bad, but I also have some diastolic dysfunction going on. My E/A ratio is 1 and my E/E' is between 8-15. Oh, and my LA (that's left atrium) is 21 cm^2. Yeah, I know, it's a lot of numbers and letters, but basically, my heart is not pumping as efficiently as it should be.

But here's the good news - I've been working hard to get healthier. I've already lost 24 kg (that's like 53 lbs for my American friends) and now I'm weighing in at 110 kg (that's 242 lbs) and I'm 194 cm tall (that's 6'4"" for all you non-metric folks). My goal is to get down to 93 kg (that's 205 lbs) and I'm well on my way.

Oh, and the best part? I stopped taking those steroids and now my blood pressure is a much more manageable 123/75. So here's my question - once I get rid of this LVH, will my diastolic function go back to normal? I'm really hoping it will, because I'm working hard to get my heart back in tip-top shape.

Hey doc, so I just finished my braces a few months ago and have been using a removable retainer. But I've noticed that my overbite has started to come back, probably because I have a habit of pushing my tongue against my teeth. I know I should have worn my retainers more, but can I still get a permanent one now? Or is it too late for that?",Asian
"Hello doctor,Should I get a permanent retainer months after braces and use of a removable retainer? Part of my overbite has returned since I got my braces off due to tongue thrusting. Partly because I never wore my retainers as much as I should have. Can I get a permanent retainer at this point? Or is it too late?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. First of all, you should wear your retainer regularly. Ideal position of teeth or occlusion which is obtained with the help of orthodontic treatment is maintained by regular use of orthodontic retainer. Use of orthodontic retainer is equally important and is part of orthodontic treatment. You can read about orthodontic retainer from ChatDoctor articles. As per your description, you have tongue thrust, so it should be corrected otherwise it will be a cause of relapse after successful orthodontic treatment. You can read about tongue thrust from ChatDoctor articles. As you have stated that your bite has relapsed, so if you use permanent retainer then it will retain faulty occlusion.

Hey there doc,

I'm a 25-year-old gal and my hubby and I have been trying to have a baby for about a year and a half now.

Hey there, doctor!

I just got my lab test results back and I was hoping you could help me understand them. My HBsAg is showing as 5638.62, which I believe is reactive. My anti HBs is 0.00 and nonreactive, and my anti HAV IgG (reverse) is 1.06 and reactive. However, my anti HCV is 0.520 and nonreactive. My SGPT is 19, which I know is within the normal range (less than or equal to 41 U/L).

I have some other tests scheduled, including an HBV DNA-PCR (viral load) and a fibroscan for chronic HBV. My SGPT is normal, by the way.

As she has PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), her ovulation date cannot be predicted. So there is always a chance of pregnancy. But as she had bleeding after having tablet Regestrone, pregnancy is not possible. Bleeding after having hormones will be thicker and lesser than normal, that is expected. Once the bleeding occurs, the inner lining of the uterus has fully been shed, so there is no chance of a possible pregnancy to get implanted on the post bleeding, thinned out uterine inner lining. So I do not see any chance of her being pregnant. But if you are still not satisfied or want a further confirmation, have her blood serum beta hCG tested. This can detect the smallest of pregnancy anywhere in the body.  "," Hey doc, me and my girl had some unprotected action about a month ago. I busted a nut before we got down, but didn't during.

The day before yesterday, she got her periods. But she did not have blood clots and flow is very slow. Is there any chance of pregnancy?","Hi. How are you doing? As she has PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), her ovulation date cannot be predicted. So there is always a chance of pregnancy. But as she had bleeding after having tablet Regestrone, pregnancy is not possible. Bleeding after having hormones will be thicker and lesser than normal, that is expected. Once the bleeding occurs, the inner lining of the uterus has fully been shed, so there is no chance of a possible pregnancy to get implanted on the post bleeding, thinned out uterine inner lining. So I do not see any chance of her being pregnant. But if you are still not satisfied or want a further confirmation, have her blood serum beta hCG tested. This can detect the smallest of pregnancy anywhere in the body.  ","
Hi doctor,

Me and my fiancee, we had unprotected sex one month ago. Before we did it, I had an orgasm, but not during the actual sex. My fiancee has PCOD, so her periods are not regular. She went to see the doctor and the doctor told her to take three tablets of Regestrone 5 mg for three days. She started taking them 13 days later and finished the course. Two days ago, she got her period, but there were no blood clots and the flow was very slow. Do you think there is a chance she could be pregnant?",Asian

Hey doc,

So me and my girl, we did the deed about a month ago without any protection. I finished before we even got to it, but she's got this PCOD thing so her period's all over the place. She went to the doc and they told her to take three of them Regestrone 5 mg pills for three days. She started taking them like 13 days later and finished up three days after that. Then, just the other day, she finally got her period. But it's weird, there ain't no blood clots and the flow is super slow. You think there's a chance she could be preggo?",Latino

Hey there doc,

So, my fiancée and I had some unprotected action about a month ago. I gotta admit, I finished before we even got down to business. But here's the thing, she's got PCOD and her period schedule is all over the place. She went to see her doc and they recommended she take three tablets of Regestrone 5 mg for three days. She started taking them 13 days later and finished the course. Fast forward to two days ago, she finally got her period. But here's the kicker, there were no blood clots and the flow was super light.

Hi doctor,

I have been experiencing some tightness on the right side of my body. It's especially noticeable in my right knee, above the knee cap, which is causing pain in the front and top of my knee. I also feel tightness in my groin on both sides, but it's more of a locking sensation in the upper inner groin and outer hip. My right hamstring is also tight, but strangely, I don't feel a stretch when I try to stretch my right quad, unlike my left side. I also have some discomfort and tightness in my right shoulder. When I stand, I can see that my right hip is slightly lower than my left, and I also feel tightness in my lower back on the right side. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Treatment of ovarian cysts depends on the size and type of the cysts and your age. If your age is less than 40 years and if the cyst is a simple one, it will resolve with medications.

"Hello doctor,I am at my first pregnancy, and I am seven months pregnant. I have been anemic all of my life, and I am still struggling to get my iron levels up. When I went to the hospitals for my checkups, they have not said anything about my anemia.I was wondering should I request a C- section or can I have e normal delivery? Because I am scared that will I bleed out during labor if I do have natural as this happened to my mom when she was pregnant. I would like to know what would be best for the baby during birth.

Hey doc,

I'm pregnant for the first time and I'm seven months along. I've been anemic my whole life and I'm still struggling to get my iron levels up.

Hi doctor,

I'm currently pregnant with my first child and I'm in my seventh month. I've been anemic my whole life and I'm still struggling to increase my iron levels. During my checkups at the hospital, they haven't mentioned anything about my anemia.

I'm wondering if I should ask for a C-section or if I can have a normal delivery. I'm worried that I might have excessive bleeding during labor if I go for a natural birth, as my mother experienced this during her pregnancy. I just want to make sure that whatever method I choose is best for the baby's well-being during birth. Thank you for your help.",Asian

In case her sugars are in control, there is no harm in giving her a little rice. I would recommend you buy a glucometer for her so that you can monitor her sugars at all times.

Hey doc,

My mom, she's 65 and been dealing with diabetes for like 9 years now. She's on a few meds, let me break it down for you. She takes Forxiga, that's Dapagliflozin, 10 milligrams, once after lunch.

Hey doc,

So, I've been noticing these stretch marks on my body and I'm wondering what's up with that. Like, why do they even show up? And more importantly, how can I stop them from happening? I really don't want to deal with this issue, so any tips on preventing it would be super helpful. Gracias!",Latino

"Hello doctor,I had an MRV done. In the report, it said my right internal jugular vein was not visualized at the skull base. What could this possibly mean? It was never followed upon. I get terrible headaches.","Hi. The internal jugular vein carries blood from the brain and neck area to the heart. There are many reasons for the non-visualization of the internal jugular vein on MRV and the causes can be technical due to slow flow of blood or can be due to a mild compression of the vein due to a secondary cause. Rarely it can be from a thrombus in the lumen of the vein. If the MRV of the brain and rest of the internal jugular vein is normal, then the non-visualization is likely due to technical reasons and is artefactual. If you are having headaches, then it is better to talk to your doctors and get a neck venous Doppler done to rule out any external compression of the vein or any luminal thrombosis of chronic nature.

"Hi doctor,Two years ago, I felt a pop while playing football. My physiotherapist said Ihave torn my cartilage and so, he advised me to take rest. It felt good. After 18 months, when I played football again for some half an hour, I felt the pain. So, I visited a different physiotherapist, and he advised me to go with some exercise for a 4-6 week every day. I am visiting him every week. While playing in the pool on Friday, it gave way again, and I could not straighten my legs.","Hello. Thank you for providing a brief history. As you had this injury persisting from 2 years now, I will advise getting a proper examination with the physiotherapist you been seeing for now and provide me the reports. Because the muscles must have got weaker and there will be a muscle imbalance due to which there is difficulty in straightening the leg now. I think an MRI of the knee will be helpful as in the beginning what I feel is it was left untreated and due to which it has become a chronic injury. Doing balance board training should help regain the correction of the muscle imbalance. Also, do reverse jogging and provide good core stability exercise. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most sports injury cases take up to 12 weeks which has helped them to have a good outcome score.  Take care.","

My physiotherapist told me that I had torn my cartilage and advised me to take some rest. It actually helped and I felt better after that. But, just last month, I decided to play football again for about half an hour and the pain came back. So, I went to see another physiotherapist and he suggested some exercises for me to do every day for 4-6 weeks. I've been going to him every week and it seemed to be working. But, last Friday, while I was playing in the pool, my knee gave way again and I couldn't straighten my leg. Any thoughts on what I should do next?",Asian
"Hi doctor,Two years ago, I felt a pop while playing football. My physiotherapist said Ihave torn my cartilage and so, he advised me to take rest. It felt good. After 18 months, when I played football again for some half an hour, I felt the pain. So, I visited a different physiotherapist, and he advised me to go with some exercise for a 4-6 week every day. I am visiting him every week. While playing in the pool on Friday, it gave way again, and I could not straighten my legs.","Hello. Thank you for providing a brief history. As you had this injury persisting from 2 years now, I will advise getting a proper examination with the physiotherapist you been seeing for now and provide me the reports. Because the muscles must have got weaker and there will be a muscle imbalance due to which there is difficulty in straightening the leg now. I think an MRI of the knee will be helpful as in the beginning what I feel is it was left untreated and due to which it has become a chronic injury. Doing balance board training should help regain the correction of the muscle imbalance. Also, do reverse jogging and provide good core stability exercise.

"Hello doctor,Recently after watching a video of a young person dying of heart attack, I have developed a fear of death. Although I am young and have no heart problems, I tend to think about it all the time. Please help me to get rid of this.","Hello. Here are two kinds of fears or phobias. 1) Temporary. 2) Permanent. Temporary lasts for few days after you suffer or witness some traumatic thing. Permanent ones would slightly fall under some psychiatric issues worth paying attention. I would recommend you to wait for some time. Keep yourself busy with positive and productive things and try to be in the company of family or friends. Try deep breathing, meditation and running. Everything should be settled by two weeks. If it does not, then consult a psychiatrist for proper evaluation and treatment.  Take care.","

Hey there doc,

So, about three months ago, I had unprotected sex. I got all the tests done, except for herpes, and they all came back negative. But, here's the thing - every one to two weeks since then, I've been getting these red rashes and tiny red dots all over my glans penis and foreskin. They're not raised, don't itch, and only last for a couple of seconds a day. No discharge either. But, sometimes my penis has a bit of an odor.

The dots usually disappear on their own after three days, but then they can pop up again after a week or two. And, I gotta say, there's nothing that seems like it could be herpes. My penis also gets pretty dry and wrinkly at times. Just wanted to mention that all my STD and HIV tests were negative too. Any ideas on what could be causing this? Thanks, doc.",White

His blood test came back with a high RBC count of 13.4 g and WBC count of 11300, with 16% leukocytes. This all went down about a month ago and he's still coughing up a storm.

Hi doctor,

I'm worried about my father, who is 70 years old. He has lost 5 kg of weight in just 2-3 months. The results of his ultrasound and CECT scan show a large, well-defined mass in the mid-lower polar region of his right kidney. It measures 11.3*10.6*12.0 cm and has a soft tissue density with some areas that do not enhance. There are no signs of calcification or fat content. The mass seems to be involving the renal fascia and has increased blood vessels, indicating a possible mitotic mass lesion (RCC) in the right kidney. However, the right renal vein and IVC are clear, and there is no evidence of metastasis. My father's urine test and renal functions are normal. The mass is also not causing any major disruption to the surrounding structures, except for slight indentation on the right psoas muscle. Can you please tell me if this is a benign or malignant mass? And what are the recommended treatment options? I would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you.",Asian

Hey there, doctor! My dad, who's 70 years old, has lost about 11 pounds in the past two to three months. We got some tests done and it looks like he has a pretty big mass on his right kidney.

Besides, a positive test does not always indicate an active infection. The fact that your tests resulted in positive means that you have gone through this infection in the past. In fact, herpes 1 is a very common infection (almost everyone has gone through it). So, I do not think that your symptoms are related to these types of infections. In many cases, no cause of peripheral neuropathy is found (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy).

I have high blood pressure and anxiety, and the neurologists couldn't figure out the cause after running all sorts of tests. I did test negative for HIV, but I did test positive for herpes 1 and 2. Is it possible that herpes could be causing my neuropathy? It's been quite a while since I first started experiencing these symptoms.",Asian
"Hello doctor,I have developed feet neuropathy, primarily the right foot from the past one year. The symptoms went away six months back but returned a month back (burning, tingling, etc). I suffer from high blood pressure and anxiety. The neurologists could not find the cause after all tests. I tested negative for HIV but tested positive for herpes 1 and 2. Can herpes cause this? It has been so long since I had these symptoms.","Hello. It is less likely that your symptoms are related to herpes. Herpes infection does not usually lead to such a clinical situation. Besides, a positive test does not always indicate an active infection. The fact that your tests resulted in positive means that you have gone through this infection in the past. In fact, herpes 1 is a very common infection (almost everyone has gone through it). So, I do not think that your symptoms are related to these types of infections. In many cases, no cause of peripheral neuropathy is found (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy). Regarding the pain and burning sensation, I would recommend starting treatment with Pregabalin or Gabapentin. Another possible treatment option would be Duloxetine. I would also advise you to be active. Physical therapy can help improve your clinical situation. You should discuss with your doctor about the above treatment options.

Hey doc,

So, I've been dealing with this feet neuropathy for about a year now, mainly on my right foot. It actually went away for a while, but then it came back about a month ago. And let me tell you, it's been a real pain in the butt. Literally, my foot feels like it's on fire and I get these weird tingling sensations. It's been driving me crazy.

I already went to see some neurologists and they ran all sorts of tests, but they couldn't figure out what's causing it. I do have high blood pressure and anxiety, but they said that shouldn't be the cause. And get this, I even got tested for HIV and it came back negative. But then, I tested positive for herpes 1 and 2. Can you believe that? Could herpes be the culprit behind all this madness? It's been so long since I've had these symptoms, I just want to get to the bottom of it. Any thoughts, doc?",Latino

Hey there doc,

I've been dealing with some gnarly neuropathy in my right foot for about a year now. It actually went away for a while, but then came back with a vengeance about a month ago. The burning and tingling sensations are no joke. I've got high blood pressure and anxiety to top it off, and even after all the tests my neurologist ran, we still can't figure out the root cause. I did test negative for HIV, but I did test positive for herpes 1 and 2. Could that be the culprit? It's been a hot minute since I've had these symptoms, so I'm just trying to get some answers.",White

You must have got the second treatment done and then at end get fixed retainer at palatal and lingual side of your teeth for like good 10 years. This is the only way to avoid relapse. Moreover, if you are having tongue thrust, there is an appliance for it. I would suggest you to get treatment done (which could be fourth time) with conventional bracketing. And at the end, ask the dentist to put fixed retainer. After it gives you an appliance to limit tongue thrust. This would not cause relapse, hopefully. I could suggest you more proper treatment plan if you can provide me with clinical pictures of before, after treatment and now recent ones too. ","
Hey doc,

So, I've had braces three times already. The first time was when I was a kid, and then again as an adult. I had the metal ones, and I was super strict about wearing my retainer for a whole year. But even then, my teeth decided to do their own thing and shift back. Then I tried Invisalign, but it wasn't really my jam. Now I'm thinking about giving it another go, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. My teeth just won't stay put, and apparently I have this thing called a tongue thrust that keeps messing them up. Do you think I'm just wasting my time with braces? I've also been considering veneers, but I don't know if my teeth are even eligible for that. What do you think, doc?",Latino

Hey there, doc! So, I've had braces three times now. The first time was when I was a kid, and then again as an adult. I started off with the classic metal braces, and I was super diligent about wearing my retainer for a whole year. But even with all that effort, my teeth still ended up shifting. So then I tried Invisalign, but it wasn't really my jam. Now I'm thinking about giving it another go, but I'm wondering if it's even worth it.

"Hi doctor,Is it right to have unprotected sex without a condom? Can I take an emergency contraceptive pill after it?","Hi. An emergency pill is meant only for emergency and during accidental contacts. It should not be used for a routine purpose. It is better to go for a consistent method of contraception like condoms and oral contraceptive pills. Cyclical oral contraceptive pills have very less failure rate when compared to emergency pills.

Hello doctor,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek your advice on a persistent pain in my right lower back. Two years ago, I had an injury in my left SI joint which caused me to favor my right side while lying, walking, and sitting. While my left side has healed, I have developed a tingling and burning sensation in my right lower back.

I have undergone several tests, including an MRI and x-ray of my spine and SI joints, all of which came back normal. My blood tests for ankylosing spondylitis, RA factor, hemogram, LFT, and KFT also showed no abnormalities. However, the pain in my right lower back persists, feeling like pins and needles and sometimes a burning sensation.

Recently, I had a bone scan done which revealed some abnormalities. I have attached the report for your reference. I would greatly appreciate your professional opinion on the best course of treatment for my condition.

Thank you for your time and expertise.

Sincerely,

- Feeling the need to use the bathroom every time someone else does, even if she doesn't actually need to go
- Showing an unhealthy obsession with her husband and daughter, and getting angry over small things when they're around. She seems normal around other people, though.

She's been taking some medication, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. Here's what she's currently on: Procyclidine, Clobazam, Risdon LS, Amisulpride, and Theophylline.

Thank you for your help.",Asian
"Hello doctor,One of my relatives is facing some psychological problems for quite some time and she is under treatment as well. She has the following symptoms:Mood swings.Everything available she wants to eat even though she is not hungry.Every time if anyone goes to washroom she also goes even without any feeling of nature\s call.Sometimes she displays an obsession with her husband and daughter. She otherwise remains normal in front of strangers but in presence of her husband and daughter she shows obsessive behavior and becomes furious over petty issues as well. She is undergoing treatment but not much improvement is seen. Following is the list of medication: Procyclidine, Clobazam, Risdon LS, Amisulpride, and Theophylline.","Hello. Her symptoms suggest some psychotic behavior but this should be evaluated in detail. Mood swings with episodes of irritation, anger outbursts could be part of some mood disorder. She eats a lot, she goes to the washroom without any need and this might be due to abnormal behavior resulted due to some psychosis. What kind of obsession she has? Please describe in details. Does she show behaviors like overspending, not listening to others, feelings that only she is right and others are wrong, argumentativeness, reduced sleep, over religious behavior, etc?

Hey doc, mi tía has been dealing with some psychological issues for a while now and she's been getting treatment. She's been showing these symptoms:

- Cambios de humor
- Ganas de comer todo lo que ve, aunque no tenga hambre
- Si alguien va al baño, ella también va sin tener necesidad
- A veces se obsesiona con su esposo e hija. En frente de extraños parece normal, pero con su familia se pone obsesiva y se enoja por cosas pequeñas. Está recibiendo tratamiento, pero no ha mejorado mucho. Aquí está la lista de medicamentos que está tomando: Procyclidine, Clobazam, Risdon LS, Amisulpride y Theophylline.",Latino

Hey there, doctor! I'm a bit worried about one of my family members. They've been dealing with some psychological issues for a while now and are currently receiving treatment. I've noticed a few concerning symptoms, such as frequent mood swings and an insatiable appetite for food, even when they're not hungry. They also have a strange habit of following others to the bathroom, even when they don't need to go. But what's really concerning is their behavior towards their husband and daughter. They seem to have an unhealthy obsession with them and can become quite aggressive over small things. It's strange because they seem perfectly normal around strangers. They're currently taking Procyclidine, Clobazam, Risdon LS, Amisulpride, and Theophylline, but I haven't seen much improvement. Any advice, doc?",White

Hey doc,

So I had this issue with my nose being all blocked up, and my ENT surgeon was like, ""Yo, you need to get a nose operation."" So I went ahead and got it done about three months ago. My nose is feeling pretty good now, but I still got this weird feeling in my throat. It's like something's stuck there, you know? And it's always itchy, like I gotta make a noise every 10 minutes just to get some relief. My ENT surgeon told me to take this medicine called Levocet M for my throat, one tablet every night for six months, and it's supposed to help. But I been taking it for three months now and my throat still ain't right. Should I keep taking it or stop? And like, is there any side effects if I keep taking it for a long time? Maybe you got some other medicine you can recommend? I just wanna get this throat situation sorted out, you feel me? Thanks, doc.",African American

"Hi doctor,I am 56 years old male. I have eye floaters problem. I have blood pressure. I am taking tablets for it.","Hi. The floaters in the front of the eye indicate disease in the posterior segment of the eye that is retina or vitreous. As you have raised blood pressure, though you are taking medication, you have an increased chance of having retina and vitreous problems. You can get your dilated examination to check the posterior segment.

Hey doc,

So, I been dealing with this little stiff boil on my eyelid for like, months now. It was right in the middle and just wouldn't go away. Then, outta nowhere, it disappeared and another one popped up on the outer corner of the same eye (my right one). And let me tell you, it's been playing games with me - getting bigger, then smaller, but never fully disappearing.

But then, about six months later, I started feeling some pain when I blinked. And when I checked it out, there was another boil under my eyelid, just chillin' with a bunch of pus. I didn't wanna mess with it, so I left it alone. But the next day, I woke up and my whole eyelid was swollen and throbbing like crazy. It was rough, but the pain eventually went down after a few hours.

But then, I noticed another boil inside my eyelid. Like, what the heck? This one ended up bursting on its own, but now I got three boils in my eyelid. And the third one is in the inner corner of my eye. Is this something serious, doc? I'm kinda worried here.",African American

Hey doctor,

I have a little problem with my eye. For a few months now, I had a small, hard bump in the middle of my eyelid. It didn't bother me much, but then it disappeared and another one popped up in the outer corner of the same eye (my right one). This one kept changing size and hasn't gone away yet.

Then, about six months later, I blinked and it hurt. I felt another bump under my eyelid and when I looked, it was full of pus. I didn't touch it, but the next day when I woke up, my whole eyelid was swollen and really painful. Luckily, the pain went down after a few hours. But then I noticed another bump inside my eyelid.

Hey there, doctor!

I've been dealing with this pesky issue for a while now and I'm starting to get a little worried. You see, I had this small, stiff boil on my eyelid for months and it just wouldn't go away. Then, out of nowhere, it disappeared and another one popped up in the outer corner of the same eye (my right one). This one has been fluctuating in size and hasn't gone away either.

But here's where it gets really concerning. About six months later, I blinked and felt a sharp pain under my eyelid. When I checked it out, I saw that there was another boil filled with pus. Yuck, I know. I didn't touch it, but the next day when I woke up, my entire eyelid was swollen and throbbing with pain. Thankfully, the pain subsided after a few hours, but I noticed yet another boil inside my eyelid. This one actually burst on its own, but now I have three boils in total - the third one being in the inner corner of my eye.

I'm starting to get a little freaked out. Is this something serious that I should be worried about? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",White
"Hello doctor,I am having -9 spherical and -2 and -1.5 cylindrical power in my eyes. I have a border line eye pressure. Doctor said I cannot take laser or ICL surgery but can have ReLex Smile for that power. But it also needs some cornea tissues which is a risk factor for glaucoma. I do not know what to do now? Which treatment is better for me and the doctor just gave normal lubricant drops? Is there any treatment for me for refractive surgery by controlling eye pressure?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. How much is your eye pressure? Did the doctor measure it with an instrument that puffs out air at you or was it a blue light instrument that he used to touch your eye with? From what you have told me, I understand that you are interested in refractive surgery. But the doctor refused to operate on you saying your pressures are high and that your power is too high for lasik. It is true that your power is on the higher end of the patients we usually consider for surgery so doing lasik and PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) is not possible on the eye with -9D but can be done on the eye with -2 and -1.5D. Putting an ICL (implantable contact lens) in your eye might increase your eye pressure. So I will not recommend that. ReLex SMILE can be tried in both your eyes if the surgeon is confident. I am guessing that he would have asked you to come for a follow up to re-check pressures. If the pressures were too high, he would have asked for visual fields and a few other tests for glaucoma. In either case, it all depends on the surgeon\s experience and your eye pressures. If you can tell me about your eye pressure and your vision in each eye with -9D and -2/-1.5D, I could help you better. ","
Hey doc,

So, I got this issue with my eyes. My spherical power is at -9 and I got some -2 and -1.5 cylindrical power too. And to top it off, my eye pressure is borderline.

"Hi doctor,I am 25 years old. I have been diagnosed with PCOS 3 years ago. I was on the pill till around this year however due to a few issues and after removing my gall bladder due to gall stones my GP advised I stop my pill. My periods have been on and off however I have not actually bled as such. There is just continuous dark brown discharge for a few days but no red flowing blood. What could this be and how do I go about treating it?","Hello. If you have been on pills for PCOD for more than 3 years now and yet your hormones remain uncontrolled and menses have not been regularized, then there is definitely something wrong in the treatment protocol or you may not be following the lifestyle changes which you may have been advised to follow. It is best to stop pills for at least 3 months after such a long treatment already and switch to lifestyle changes now for results. If pregnancy is not a concern lately, then the pills can be avoided. However darkish brown blood indicates irregular shedding and this could be due to isolated progesterone deficiency, which can be evaluated by your serum progesterone levels. However immediate control of bleed can be achieved with antifibrinolytics. You may discuss it with your treating gynecologist. Please feel free to discuss this further in detail. Regards.

"Hi doctor,I am having type 2 uncontrolled diabetes. My endocrinologist is asking me to undergo a bariatric surgery. Kindly advise.

Hey there, doc! I'm an 18-year-old gal, standing at 167 cm tall and weighing in at 53 kg. Lately, I've been dealing with some gnarly headaches and eye pain for the past couple of days. And to top it off, my nose has been completely stuffed up for about a week now. Every time I try to clear it out, my head feels like it's about to explode. Even just shaking my head is a major pain. Any ideas on what could be causing all this discomfort?",White
"Hello doctor,I am looking forward to have advice about the outcome or prognosis of nerve regeneration and repair for my son. Before 13 days, my 10 years old son fell with a bottle in his right-hand palm and had his palm triangle open.

Hey doc,

I need some advice about my son's nerve situation. About 13 days ago, he took a nasty fall and cut his palm open with a bottle. We were out of town, so a local surgeon cleaned it up, but then we went to another place where he had surgery 10 days ago to repair his ulnar digital nerve and median nerve. I'm not sure if that's the right term, but the nerve that got cut was the one by his index finger, on the inside (facing the third finger).

I'm wondering what the outcome of this surgery will be. Will this nerve affect his ability to use his index finger? Is it just for feeling or does it control movement too? Will he be able to bend and use his finger like normal after this? And just so you know, no other tissues were cut, like tendons or anything.

Thanks for your help, doc.",African American

Hi doctor,

I'm hoping you can give me some insight on my son's nerve regeneration and repair. About 13 days ago, my 10-year-old son had an accident where a bottle fell on his right hand, causing a deep cut in the palm. We were in a different place at the time, so a local surgeon cleaned the wound. However, I then took him to another location where he underwent surgery 10 days ago to repair the ulnar digital nerve of the median nerve. I'm not sure if that's the correct terminology, but the nerve that was cut was the one at the base of his index finger, on the inner side facing the third finger.

I'm curious about the potential outcome of this surgery. Will this nerve affect the function of his index finger? Is it only responsible for sensation? Will he be able to bend and use his index finger normally after the surgery? Thankfully, no other tissues were damaged, such as tendons.

Thank you for your time and expertise.",Asian

Hey doc,

I'm hoping you can give me some insight on how my son's nerve repair surgery will turn out. About 13 days ago, my 10-year-old boy took a tumble and ended up with a nasty cut on his right palm from a bottle. We were in a different place at the time, so a local surgeon cleaned it up, but then I took him to another spot where he had surgery 10 days ago to fix his ulnar digital nerve and median nerve. I'm not sure if that's the right term, but the nerve that got cut was the one that runs from the base of his index finger to the inner side (facing the third finger).

Can you tell me what to expect from this surgery? Will it affect his ability to use his index finger? Is it just for feeling or does it control movement too? Will he be able to bend and use his finger normally after this? And just so you know, no other tissues were damaged, like tendons or anything.
